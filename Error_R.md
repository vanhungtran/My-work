1. there is no package called 'scales'

In this case, the issue could be solved by manually installing the following packages...

install.packages("scales")
install.packages("base64enc")
install.packages("viridisLite")

install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("gtable")
install.packages("htmlwidgets")
install.packages("purrr")
install.packages("tidyr")
