      "\tAmong women with more than two children, the risk of CHD increased by 30% with each additional child. For men the figure was 12% for each additional child.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Researchers studied 4,286 women and 4,252 men aged 60 to 79 who had from zero to five or more children.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "The risks were also higher for those people who had just one child, or who remained childless.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Mothers of more than two children were also more likely to have evidence of insulin resistance, elevated blood sugar and diabetes.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "They were also more likely to have low levels of good cholesterol and increased triglycerides.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "<b>Lifestyle and biological factors</b>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Lead researcher Dr Debbie Lawlor, of the University of Bristol, said: \"Parents of large families tend to be poorer and also have less healthy lifestyles - which explains some of their increased CHD risk.\"\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "She said the different results for fathers and mothers suggest that multiple pregnancies also have a specific adverse metabolic effect on women.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "During pregnancy women become temporarily insulin resistant allowing blood sugar levels to rise to feed the growing foetus.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "It may be that multiple pregnancy raises the risk that this resistance - an important risk factor for CHD - might become permanent. \n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Dr Lawlor said: \"These results reinforce the need to encourage mothers and fathers of several children to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle which may reduce the chances of developing obesity and CHD in later life.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "\"In addition, careful screening and control of metabolic abnormalities during pregnancy should be undertaken in women receiving prenatal care, particularly among women who have had a number of earlier pregnancies.\"\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Dr Lawlor said the most likely explanation for the apparent increased risk among people with less than two children was that they were likely to suffer from general ill health.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "This could explain both increase their increased risk of CHD, and their reduced fertility.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "She said: \"It has to be remembered that these study participants are currently aged 60-79 years of age and so from a generation where voluntarily having no children or even just one child was relatively rare.\"\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "<b>Pressures</b>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "The study was part funded by the British Heart Foundation.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "A spokesperson said: \"This study shows that parents from lower socioeconomic groups are at a greater risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to the pressures of looking after a large family.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "\"Mothers in particular need to reassess their lifestyles and make changes to avoid CHD - the single biggest killer of women in the UK.   \n",
      "<p>\n",
      "\"It is interesting that fathers were also found to be at increased risk, lending further evidence of the significance of lifestyle factors in the development of CHD.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "\"Avoiding obesity, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables, stopping smoking, more physical activity and an awareness of blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels will all help reduce the chance of CHD.\"\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "The research is published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n",

      "In most situations it would be deemed unwise to tramp across a farmer's fields in the wee small hours dressed in camouflage gear while carrying weapons, but Steve Rogers marches confidently across the frozen grass of Stromness, Orkney, frosted blades snapping and icy puddles splintering under his combat boots, as we approach a saltwater loch where we can hear the faint honking of resident geese.\n",
      "\"I'll get the hide up first,\" whispers Steve into the darkness as he plonks a rolled-up grille intricately laced with reeds onto the ground and unwinds it.\n",
      "\"Then I'll set some decoys so they'll think their little friends are already feeding.\" He smiles at the two men following him. \"You boys get your guns ready.\"\n",
      "In 2002, according to RSPB figures, there were just 300 breeding pairs of greylag geese in Orkney. Six years later that number had increased to a startling 10,000. Fast forward to today and the resident goose population - and no-one knows quite why - has soared to a staggering 64,000. That's an awful lot of beaks and big webbed feet trampling grass and eating crops.\n",
      "\"The damage they do in a short space of time is unbelievable,\" says Steve, who runs Orkney Shooting Holidays, as he prepares to call the geese with his whistle in the first light of dawn. \"What we're doing isn't really a sport any more, it's a necessity.\"\n",
      "And it's also perfectly legal. Islanders have been allowed to control a set number of the birds since 2012, but the economic and environmental impact of goose grazing is now so serious for crofters that Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the body charged with protecting Scotland's wildlife, gave its backing to a larger cull this summer, even recruiting volunteer shooters. It has since extended the cull until the beginning of next year.\n",
      "\"Coming over on the left!\" Steve stage-whispers to his two clients crouching inside the hide. \"Get 'em, boys!\"\n",
      "The guns crack out a flurry of shots and Steve releases his Labrador, Jack, who races out to retrieve the fallen birds, darting in and out of the plastic decoys, searching for the casualties. His tail thumps proudly against the reed-camouflaged screen as he carries in the last goose and dumps it in front of his master. Four large, and very dead, greylag geese now share our small hide.\n",
      "\"They ruin my barley!\" complains Alister Donaldson, the farmer whose land we are shooting on.\n",
      "\"They're a major problem,\" he continues, shoving back his woollen hat on his head irritably. \"They go for the barley at harvest time, just before it's ready, and they pluck out the young grass and they ruin it. There are that many of them trampling, they soon make a dent on the grass, the crops.\"\n",
      "He nods towards Steve and his two shooters who are checking their guns.\n",
      "\"The numbers aren't dropping fast enough. We need more of these, we need more shooters.\"\n",

Graham Neville, Scottish Natural Heritage's Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, says SNH's policy towards the geese is about finding sustainable solutions while still fulfilling its nature conservation obligations.\n",
      "One option being considered is egg-oiling, where eggs are coated in paraffin oil. This deprives the fertilised egg of oxygen and prevents chicks from developing.\n",

      "In Steve's hide, where the temperature has spiked upwards to a spiteful -3C, the shooters pass round a flask of scalding, sweet coffee as they wait for the next skein of geese to lift off the lake and fly towards the decoys in the field. Jack whines impatiently, his wagging tail ruffling the dead goose feathers, desperate to be released back into the field. When he sees the shooters take aim, he shivers with excitement.\n",

Talcott of Boston\\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\\nDr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University. \\n\\nThe Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in \"very modest amounts\" in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.\\nFrom 1953 to 1955, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold, the company said. \\n\\nAmong 33 men who worked closely with the substance, 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number.\\nFour of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.\\nThe total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said. \\n\\n\"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases,\" said Dr. Talcott. \\n\\nThe percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries, he said.\\nThe plant, which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co., was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters. \\n\\nThe finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said. \\n\\nThe U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn\\'t have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.\\nMore common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body, Dr. Mossman explained. \\n\\nIn July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.\\nBy 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed. \\n\\nAbout 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s.\\nAreas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.\\nWorkers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.\\nWorkers described \"clouds of blue dust\" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area. \\n\\n\"There\\'s no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases,\" said Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose. \"But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.\\nIt has no bearing on our work force today.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nYields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates. \\n\\nThe average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue\\'s Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.\\nCompound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. \\n\\nAverage maturity of the funds\\' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue\\'s.\\nLonger maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.\\nShorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner. \\n\\nThe average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days. \\n\\nNevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields \"may blip up again before they blip down\" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.\\nThe yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday\\'s auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%. \\n\\nDespite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds.\\nAssets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion. \\n\\nTypically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.\\nThe top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%.\\nDreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.\\nIt invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield.\\nThe average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.\\nThe 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJ.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co., which holds a 83.4% interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director.\\nHe succeeds Terrence D. Daniels, formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman, who resigned.\\nW.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy\\'s seven board seats. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nPacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $27 a share, or $212 million. \\n\\nThe thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nMcDermott International Inc. said its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p.\\nA. for $295 million. \\n\\nFinmeccanica is an Italian state-owned holding company with interests in the mechanical engineering industry. \\n\\nBailey Controls, based in Wickliffe, Ohio, makes computerized industrial controls systems.\\nIt employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $370 million. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn\\'t lifted the ceiling on government debt. \\n\\nUntil Congress acts, the government hasn\\'t any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said. \\n\\nThe government\\'s borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $2.80 trillion from $2.87 trillion.\\nLegislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes. \\n\\nThe House has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion, but the Senate isn\\'t expected to act until next week at the earliest.\\nThe Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress doesn\\'t act by then. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nClark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp.\\nIn the new position he will oversee Mazda\\'s U.S. sales, service, parts and marketing operations.\\nPreviously, Mr. Vitulli, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. \\'s Chrysler division.\\nHe had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nWhen it\\'s time for their biannual powwow, the nation\\'s manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs. \\n\\nNot this year. \\n\\nThe National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.\\nAnd the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.\\nThe idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn\\'t so rusty after all, that it\\'s a good place for a company to expand. \\n\\nOn the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory. \\n\\nFor starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge.\\nChampagne and dessert followed. \\n\\nThe next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights.\\nThe governor couldn\\'t make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.\\nA buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors.\\nThen, in the guests\\' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race. \\n\\nAfter the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.\\nNo dummies, the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor\\'s name or two. \\n\\nBack downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.\\nThis time, it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away. \\n\\nUnder the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.\\nKnowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation. \\n\\nMore than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.\\nBut for now, they\\'re looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nSouth Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million in October, reflecting the country\\'s economic sluggishness, according to government figures released Wednesday. \\n\\nPreliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, casting a cloud on South Korea\\'s export-oriented economy. \\n\\nExports in October stood at $5.29 billion, a mere 0.7% increase from a year earlier, while imports increased sharply to $5.39 billion, up 20% from last October. \\n\\nSouth Korea\\'s economic boom, which began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports.\\nGovernment officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion. \\n\\nDespite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million so far this year. \\n\\nFrom January to October, the nation\\'s accumulated exports increased 4% from the same period last year to $50.45 billion.\\nImports were at $50.38 billion, up 19%. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nNewsweek, trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers. \\n\\nThe new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.\\nPlans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc. \\'s Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman\\'s U.S. News & World Report. \\n\\nAlan Spoon, recently named Newsweek president, said Newsweek\\'s ad rates would increase 5% in January.\\nA full, four-color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980.\\nIn mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Time\\'s ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000.\\nU.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates. \\n\\nNewsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which awards space credits to advertisers on \"renewal advertising.\" The magazine will reward with \"page bonuses\" advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 in 1989 and $340,000 in 1990. \\n\\nMr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek\\'s ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau. \"What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall,\" said Mr. Spoon. \\n\\nBoth Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.\\nHowever, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.\\nAccording to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.\\nNewsweek\\'s circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year.\\nU.S. News\\' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nNew England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer. \\n\\nThe move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company. \\n\\nNew England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., had offered $2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire, well below the $2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth.\\nUnited Illuminating is based in New Haven, Conn., and Northeast is based in Hartford, Conn.\\nPS of New Hampshire, Manchester, N.H., values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion. \\n\\nJohn Rowe, president and chief executive officer of New England Electric, said the company\\'s return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didn\\'t come true. \"When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.\\nThat got hard to take,\" he added. \\n\\nMr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric.\\nNo matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said. \"That attracts attention . . . it was just another one of the risk factors\" that led to the company\\'s decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added. \\n\\nWilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the troubled company\\'s equity holders, said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process.\\nThe fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8% over seven years against around 5.5% boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials, Mr. Ross asserted. \"Now the field is less cluttered,\" he added. \\n\\nSeparately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire.\\nNortheast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court. \\n\\nPS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nNorman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys \"R\" Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.\\nThey succeed Daniel M. Rexinger, retired Circuit City executive vice president, and Robert R. Glauber, U.S. Treasury undersecretary, on the 12-member board. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nCommonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant. \\n\\nThe refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility. \\n\\nState court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period.\\nJudge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldn\\'t entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison. \"The refund pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals,\" Judge Curry said. \\n\\nCommonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry\\'s order. \\n\\nThe exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year.\\nCommonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $1.55 a share.\\nFor 1988, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share. \\n\\nA Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be \"an administrative nightmare.\" \\n\\nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commonwealth Edison closed at $38.375, down 12.5 cents. \\n\\nThe $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford, Ill., was completed in 1985.\\nIn a disputed 1985 ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant.\\nBut state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission\\'s rate increase and found the rates illegal.\\nThe Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison\\'s construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.\\nThe utility has been collecting for the plant\\'s construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986. \\n\\nIn August, the commission ruled that between $190 million and $195 million of the plant\\'s construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded, plus interest.\\nIn his ruling, Judge Curry added an additional $55 million to the commission\\'s calculations.\\nLast month, Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9%. \\n\\nCommonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $140 million.\\nAnd consumer groups hope that Judge Curry\\'s Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison\\'s Braidwood 2 plant.\\nCommonwealth Edison is seeking about $245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2.\\nThe commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end. \\n\\nLast year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJapan\\'s domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers\\' Association said. \\n\\nThe strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21% in August and 12% in September.\\nThe monthly sales have been setting records every month since March. \\n\\nOctober sales, compared with the previous month, inched down 0.4%. \\n\\nSales of passenger cars grew 22% from a year earlier to 361,376 units.\\nSales of medium-sized cars, which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax, more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nTexas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices. \\n\\nThe new plant, located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea, the company said. \\n\\nThe plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray. \\n\\nNot only is development of the new company\\'s initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.\\nDocuments filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped. \\n\\nThe documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years, the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype.\\nMoreover, there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far, though the company says it is talking with several prospects. \\n\\nWhile many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May, the strings it attached to the financing hadn\\'t been made public until yesterday. \\n\\n\"We didn\\'t have much of a choice,\" Cray Computer\\'s chief financial officer, Gregory Barnum, said in an interview. \"The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3, and without him it could not be completed.\\nCray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour.\" \\n\\nThe documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $120 million in financing beginning next September.\\nBut Mr. Barnum called that \"a worst-case\" scenario. \\n\\nThe filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $2.875 yesterday to close at $38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \\n\\nAnalysts noted yesterday that Cray Research\\'s decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray\\'s presence will complicate a valuation of the new company. \"It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor,\" said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc., Minneapolis. \"Cray Computer will be a concept stock,\" he said. \"You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don\\'t.\" \\n\\nBesides the designer\\'s age, other risk factors for Mr. Cray\\'s new company include the Cray-3\\'s tricky, unproven chip technology.\\nThe SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.\\nIn addition, the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer. \\n\\nCray Computer also will face intense competition, not only from Cray Research, which has about 60% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine, a direct competitor with the Cray-3, in 1991.\\nThe spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan\\'s Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. \\n\\nThe new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $15 million and $30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range. \\n\\nUnder terms of the spinoff, Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.\\nNo price for the new shares has been set.\\nInstead, the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide.\\nCray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq. \\n\\nAnalysts calculate Cray Computer\\'s initial book value at about $4.75 a share.\\nAlong with the note, Cray Research is transferring about $53 million in assets, primarily those related to the Cray-3 development, which has been a drain on Cray Research\\'s earnings. \\n\\nPro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff.\\nWithout the Cray-3 research and development expenses, the company would have been able to report a profit of $19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $5.9 million it posted.\\nOn the other hand, had it existed then, Cray Computer would have incurred a $20.5 million loss. \\n\\nMr. Cray, who couldn\\'t be reached for comment, will work for the new Colorado Springs, Colo., company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research.\\nRegarded as the father of the supercomputer, Mr. Cray was paid $600,000 at Cray Research last year.\\nAt Cray Computer, he will be paid $240,000. \\n\\nBesides Messrs.\\nCray and Barnum, other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport, 47, president and chief executive officer; Joseph M. Blanchard, 37, vice president, engineering; Malcolm A. Hammerton, 40, vice president, software; and Douglas R. Wheeland, 45, vice president, hardware.\\nAll came from Cray Research. \\n\\nCray Computer, which currently employs 241 people, said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJohn R. Stevens, 49 years old, was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, both new positions.\\nHe will continue to report to Donald Pardus, president and chief executive officer.\\nMr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company.\\nArthur A. Hatch, 59, was named executive vice president of the company.\\nHe was previously president of the company\\'s Eastern Edison Co. unit.\\nJohn D. Carney, 45, was named to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison.\\nPreviously he was vice president of Eastern Edison.\\nRobert P. Tassinari, 63, was named senior vice president of Eastern Utilities.\\nHe was previously vice president. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe U.S., claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights. \\n\\nHowever, five other countries -- China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced.\\nUnder the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they don\\'t improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring. \\n\\nMrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made \"genuine progress\" on this touchy issue.\\nShe said there is \"growing realization\" around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the \"creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} country\\'s own citizens.\" \\n\\nU.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there. \\n\\nMrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.\\nSeoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams, she said. \\n\\nTaiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.\\nThat measure could compel Taipei\\'s growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films. \\n\\nSaudi Arabia, for its part, has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, Mrs. Hills said. \\n\\nThese three countries aren\\'t completely off the hook, though.\\nThey will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries.\\nThose countries -- including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the \"priority\" list. \\n\\nGary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country\\'s own interest, prompted the improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. \"What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working,\" he said.\\nHe said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law. \\n\\nMrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about \"disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia.\" She didn\\'t elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey. \\n\\nThe 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30.\\nSo far, Mrs. Hills hasn\\'t deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nArgentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world. \\n\\nThe declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature.\\nThe Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year. \\n\\n\"Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt,\" Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde. \\n\\nMr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford.\\nArgentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks. \\n\\nMr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.\\nBut he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven. \\n\\n.START \\n\\n(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) \\n\\nTHREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977. \\n\\nThat year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80

Maxwell, said at a news conference.\\nHe said more than 90% of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors.\\nThe rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong. \\n\\nEarlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, $570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund.\\nThat fund was put together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank.\\nThe latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan\\'s Daiwa Securities Co. \\n\\nThe new, seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors.\\nFirst, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates.\\nSecond, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the administrative burden on investors. \\n\\nBy addressing those problems, Mr. Maxwell said, the new funds have become \"extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S.\" \\n\\nSuch devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.\\nThey also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae\\'s corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJames L.

Simon & Co., a Washington-based research firm. \\n\\nThe turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal.\\nNext week, the Philippine Fund\\'s launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here. \\n\\nThe next province? \"Anything\\'s possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund?\" quips George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.\\nThe recent explosion of country funds mirrors the \"closed-end fund mania\" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.\\nThey fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash. \\n\\nUnlike traditional open-end mutual funds, most of these one-country portfolios are the \"closed-end\" type, issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly. \\n\\nThe surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London.\\nThese funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets. \\n\\n\"People are looking to stake their claims\" now before the number of available nations runs out, says Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York. \\n\\nBehind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.\\nAs individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.\\nAnd the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it. \\n\\nFinancial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.\\nAnd many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.\\nCountry funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies. \\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t take much to get burned.\\nPolitical and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.\\nAnother concern: The funds\\' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.\\nWhen the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%.\\nAnd most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash. \\n\\nWhat\\'s so wild about the funds\\' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.\\nAfter trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.\\nThe reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold. \\n\\nIt\\'s probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say.\\nBut some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.\\nIt has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992\\'s European economic integration.\\nAnd several new funds that aren\\'t even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums. \\n\\n\"I\\'m very alarmed to see these rich valuations,\" says Smith Barney\\'s Mr. Porter. \\n\\nThe newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests.\\nUnlike many U.S. investors, those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds. \\n\\n\"There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here,\" Mr. Porter says. \\n\\nNonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.\\nThey argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S.\\nThat way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium. \\n\\nFor people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds, Newgate\\'s Mr. Foot says: \"The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said. \\n\\nIf the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that it\\'s \"too early to say\" whether that will happen. \\n\\nCoincident with the talks, the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch.\\nThe branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July. \\n\\nBut a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million debt, which was lent to the country\\'s short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917. \\n\\nUnder a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it\\'s illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\\nThe U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization. \\n\\nMoscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value. \\n\\nThe State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act.\\nBut the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nIn another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off, the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.\\nIts index inched up to 47.6% in October from 46% in September.\\nAny reading below 50% suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining. \\n\\nThe purchasing managers, however, also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline. \\n\\nFactories booked $236.74 billion in orders in September, nearly the same as the $236.79 billion in August, the Commerce Department said.\\nIf not for a 59.6% surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors, factory orders would have fallen 2.1%. \\n\\nIn a separate report, the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $415.6 billion, not significantly different from the $415.8 billion reported for August.\\nPrivate construction spending was down, but government building activity was up.\\nThe figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren\\'t adjusted for inflation. \\n\\nKenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.\\nAt the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry. \\n\\n\"What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack?\" he asked. \"I draw a blank.\" \\n\\nBy most measures, the nation\\'s industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all.\\nFactory payrolls fell in September.\\nSo did the Federal Reserve Board\\'s industrial-production index. \\n\\nYet many economists aren\\'t predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession.\\nThey cite a lack of \"imbalances\" that provide early warning signals of a downturn. \\n\\nInventories are closely watched for such clues, for instance.\\nEconomists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession.\\nBut yesterday\\'s factory orders report had good news on that front: it said factory inventories fell 0.1% in September, the first decline since February 1987. \\n\\n\"This conforms to the `soft landing\\' scenario,\" said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. \"I don\\'t see any signs that inventories are excessive.\" A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession. \\n\\nThe department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3% in September to $109.73 billion after climbing 0.9% the month before.\\nOrders for durable goods were up 0.2% to $127.03 billion after rising 3.9% the month before.\\nThe department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1% in September. \\n\\nFactory shipments fell 1.6% to $234.4 billion after rising 5.4% in August.\\nShipments have been relatively level since January, the Commerce Department noted. \\n\\nManufacturers\\' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion, helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.\\nExcluding these orders, backlogs declined 0.3%. \\n\\nIn its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion.\\nDavid Berson, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes, but probably not until early next year. \\n\\nSpending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.\\nGovernment construction spending rose 4.3% to $88 billion. \\n\\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said construction spending didn\\'t change in September. \\n\\nFor the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year\\'s level. \\n\\nThe government\\'s construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. \\'s F.W. Dodge Group.\\nDodge reported an 8% increase in construction contracts awarded in September.\\nThe goverment counts money as it is spent; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded.\\nThe government includes money spent on residential renovation; Dodge doesn\\'t. \\n\\nAlthough the purchasing managers\\' index continues to indicate a slowing economy, it isn\\'t signaling an imminent recession, said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association\\'s survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn.\\nHe said the index would have to be in the low 40% range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession. \\n\\nThe report offered new evidence that the nation\\'s export growth, though still continuing, may be slowing.\\nOnly 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from 27% in September.\\nAnd 8% said export orders were down last month, compared with 6% the month before. \\n\\nThe purhasing managers\\' report also added evidence that inflation is under control.\\nFor the fifth consecutive month, purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell.\\nThe decline was even steeper than in September. \\n\\nThey also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months.\\nEconomists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.\\nWhen demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen, prices tend to rise. \\n\\nThe purchasing managers\\' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives.\\nEach of the survey\\'s indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening. \\n\\nFor the first time, the October survey polled members on imports.\\nIt found that of the 73% who import, 10% said they imported more in October and 12% said they imported less than the previous month.\\nWhile acknowledging one month\\'s figures don\\'t prove a trend, Mr. Bretz said, \"It does lead you to suspect imports are going down, or at least not increasing that much.\" \\n\\nItems listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen, but they included one newcomer: milk and milk powder. \"It\\'s an odd thing to put on the list,\" Mr. Bretz noted.\\nHe said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.\\nThey blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk, coupled with very low import quotas. \\n\\nPamela Sebastian in New York contributed to this article. \\n\\nHere are the Commerce Department\\'s figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates. \\n\\nHere are the Commerce Department\\'s latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJudging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami\\'s \"A Wild Sheep Chase\" (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common.\\nAlthough set in Japan, the novel\\'s texture is almost entirely Western, especially American.\\nCharacters drink Salty Dogs, whistle \"Johnny B. Goode\" and watch Bugs Bunny reruns.\\nThey read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo.\\nThey worry about their careers, drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs.\\nThis is Japan? \\n\\nFor an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan isn\\'t the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore.\\nIt\\'s also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly doesn\\'t belong to the self-aggrandizing \"we-Japanese\" school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders.\\nIf \"A Wild Sheep Chase\" carries an implicit message for international relations, it\\'s that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think. \\n\\nThat\\'s not to say that the nutty plot of \"A Wild Sheep Chase\" is rooted in reality.\\nIt\\'s imaginative and often funny.\\nA disaffected, hard-drinking, nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree.\\nHe has in tow his prescient girlfriend, whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly.\\nAlong the way, he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God\\'s phone number; and the Sheep Man, a sweet, roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin. \\n\\nThe 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan.\\nA more recent novel, \"Norwegian Wood\" (every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics), has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987.\\nBut he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo\\'s brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan.\\nTheir books are written in idiomatic, contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana. \\n\\nIn Robert Whiting\\'s \"You Gotta Have Wa\" (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a \"game.\" As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a \"mirror of Japan\\'s fabled virtues of hard work and harmony.\" \"Wa\" is Japanese for \"team spirit\" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.\\nA player\\'s commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average.\\nPolls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a \"humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul,\" as the male symbol of Japan. \\n\\nBut other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat, it\\'s unrecognizable: Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants, for example, must always wear ties when on the road. \\n\\n\"You Gotta Have Wa\" is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers, rationed to two per team, fare in Japan.\\nDespite the enormous sums of money they\\'re paid to stand up at a Japanese plate, a good number decide it\\'s not worth it and run for home. \\n\\n\"Funny Business\" (Soho, 228 pages, $17.95) by Gary Katzenstein is anything but.\\nIt\\'s the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties. \\n\\nIn sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers\\' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at \"home\" in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker. \\n\\nSome of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.\\nIt\\'s probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.\\nAll of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman. \\n\\nBut Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.\\nIt\\'s a shame their meeting never took place.\\nMr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something, and it\\'s even possible Mr. Morita would have too. \\n\\nMs. Kirkpatrick, the Journal\\'s deputy editorial features editor, worked in Tokyo for three years. \\n\\nMore and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco

After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said.\\nBut the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nBRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.\\nThe Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.\\nThe warrants expire Nov. 30, 1990.\\nThe issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9%; a spokesman declined to elaborate.\\nLead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., both Toronto-based investment dealers.\\nBramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nAs an actor, Charles Lane isn\\'t the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin\\'s spirit.\\nSteve Martin has already laid his claim to that. \\n\\nBut it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp in a contemporary way.\\nIn 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot \"A Place in Time,\" a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.\\nNow, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called \"Sidewalk Stories,\" a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.\\nOf course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane\\'s Artist would be called a homeless person.\\nSo would the Little Tramp, for that matter. \\n\\nI say \"contained dialogue\" because \"Sidewalk Stories\" isn\\'t really silent at all.\\nComposer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane\\'s who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would. \\n\\nMuch of Mr. Lane\\'s film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin\\'s notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).\\nFilmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of \"Sidewalk Stories\" seem benign.\\nOn Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs.\\nThe Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers. (This clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.) \\n\\nThe Artist has his routine.\\nHe spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to.\\nAt night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.\\nHis life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree.\\nHe is his own man. \\n\\nThen, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in \"City Lights,\" the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother.\\nThis cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse.\\nShe gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.\\nThe beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night. \\n\\nTo further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children\\'s shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building.\\nThis story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it. \\n\\nMr. Lane\\'s final purpose isn\\'t to glamorize the Artist\\'s vagabond existence.\\nHe has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.\\nThe movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn\\'t anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices. \\n\\nThe French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his \"Story of Women.\" He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that\\'s captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable. \\n\\nYet this woman, Marie-Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government\\'s hypocrisy.\\nWhile Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.\\nMarie-Louise, a small-time abortionist, was their woman. \\n\\nShe became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa and other war-rationed goodies.\\nShe was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.\\nHer remorse was shallow and brief.\\nAlthough she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.\\nAs presented by Mr. Chabrol, and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie-Louise (called Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.\\nBut she didn\\'t deserve to have her head chopped off. \\n\\nThere is very little to recommend \"Old Gringo,\" a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.\\nMost of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.\\nI mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die. \\n\\nVideo Tip: Before seeing \"Sidewalk Stories,\" take a look at \"City Lights,\" Chaplin\\'s Tramp at his finest. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nBoeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet. \\n\\nThe discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details haven\\'t been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. \\n\\nThe three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft.\\nJapanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20% and 25% under the new program. \\n\\nIf Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767, the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThis is the year the negative ad, for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns, became the main event. \\n\\nThe irony is that the attack commercial, after getting a boost in last year\\'s presidential campaign, has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country. \\n\\nBut in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content. \\n\\n\"Now,\" says Joseph Napolitan, a pioneer in political television, \"the idea is to attack first, last and always.\" \\n\\nA trend that started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage. \\n\\n\"To get people\\'s attention these days,\" says Douglas Bailey, a political consultant, \"your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining, and, more often than not, that means confrontational.\\nAnd, unlike a few years ago, you don\\'t even have to worry whether the ad is truthful.\" \\n\\nIn 1989, as often as not, the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves. \\n\\nTake a look, then, at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday\\'s elections in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia: \\n\\nNew York City: The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. \"David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years,\" says a disembodied male voice. \\n\\nAnd then this television commercial, paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani\\'s campaign and produced by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.\\nMr. Dinkins, the ad charges, also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper \"through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office.\" \\n\\n\"David Dinkins,\" says the kicker, \"Why does he always wait until he\\'s caught?\" \\n\\n\"Nasty innuendoes,\" says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins\\'s issues director, \"designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn\\'t exist.\" \\n\\nStung by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins\\'s TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.\\nThe screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians. \"Compare two candidates for mayor,\" says the announcer. \"One says he\\'s for banning cop-killer bullets.\\nThe other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets.\\nOne claims he\\'s pro-choice.\\nThe other has opposed a woman\\'s right to choose.\" \\n\\n\"Funny thing,\" says the kicker, \"both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani.\" \\n\\nWho\\'s telling the truth?\\nEverybody -- and nobody.\\nIt\\'s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate. \\n\\nMr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the \"oversight\" when he was being considered for a city job.\\nHe was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it.\\nThe city\\'s Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.\\nThe campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.\\nAnd, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn\\'t know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.\\nBut, say Mr. Dinkins\\'s managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members. \\n\\nMr. Giuliani\\'s campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says the Dinkins ad is \"deceptive.\" The other side, he argues, \"knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.\\nThey know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation.\" \\n\\nVirginia: Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.\\nAgainst a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the \"strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty\" that Virginians have nurtured for generations.\\nThen, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: \"On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians.\" \\n\\nThat commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion \"even in cases of rape and incest,\" a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.\\nThe ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder\\'s support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad. \\n\\nThe Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.\\nA voice says, \"C\\'mon, now, don\\'t you have boyfriends?\" Then an announcer interjects: \"It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.\\nSo the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass.\" \\n\\nMr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.\\nThe legislation itself noted that it was introduced \"by request,\" and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation. \\n\\n\"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner,\" says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College. \"Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman.\" \\n\\nMr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.\\nBy Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder\\'s sensitivity to rape victims. \\n\\nNew Jersey: The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio\\'s rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter. \"Remember Pinocchio?\" says a female voice. \"Consider Jim Courter.\" \\n\\nAnd then this commercial, produced by Bob Squier, gets down to its own mean and dirty business.\\nPictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, \"That hazardous waste on his {Mr.\\nCourter\\'s} property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud.\" And the nose on Mr. Courter\\'s face grows. \\n\\nThe only fraud involved, cry Mr. Courter\\'s partisans, is the Florio commercial itself, and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced by Mr. Ailes.\\nIn this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. \"Who\\'s really lying?\" asks a female voice. \"Florio\\'s lying,\" the voice goes on, because \"the barrel on Courter\\'s land . . . contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution.\" \\n\\nMr. Courter\\'s long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio\\'s grows. \\n\\nWho\\'s telling the truth?\\nStephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey\\'s Eagleton Institute, says it\\'s another example of an ad that\\'s true but not fully accurate.\\nBarrels were dumped on the Courter property, a complaint was made, but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment. \\n\\nEven so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was \"devastating\" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter\\'s credibility.\\nBut it\\'s building on a long tradition.\\nIn 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O\\'Connor, GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying, \"If you want to keep the crime rates high, O\\'Connor is your man.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nA seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $350,000, down $16,000 from the previous sale last Friday. \\n\\nSeats currently are quoted at $331,000, bid, and $350,000, asked. \\n\\nThe record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000, set Aug. 31, 1987. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJapanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration. \\n\\nInterviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.\\nBut Japan\\'s power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions. \\n\\nThe flow of Japanese funds has set in motion \"a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine,\" says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp. \\n\\nIn the past five years, Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $5.57 billion.\\nIn Thailand, for example, the government\\'s Board of Investment approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.\\nJapan\\'s commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade. \\n\\nAsia\\'s other cash-rich countries are following Japan\\'s lead and pumping capital into the region.\\nIn Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.\\nThese nations, known as Asia\\'s \"little tigers,\" also are contributing to Southeast Asia\\'s integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan\\'s. \\n\\nFor recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.\\nBut Asian nations\\' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now. \\n\\nBecause of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.\\nBut it resists yielding political ground.\\nIn the coming decade, analysts say, U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region\\'s economic behemoth. \\n\\nJapan\\'s swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.\\nIn the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.\\nIn the 1990s, spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.\\nTo capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business. \\n\\nThese nations\\' internal decisions \"will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender,\" says Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California\\'s Graduate School of Business. \\n\\nJapanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region.\\nBut, analysts say, Asian cooperation isn\\'t likely to parallel the European Common Market approach.\\nRather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.\\nIn electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia. \\n\\n\"The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone,\" says Goldman Sachs\\'s Mr. Hormats. \\n\\nCountries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.\\nThe economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.\\nParticipants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei. \\n\\nIn addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke. \\n\\nThe Baker proposal reasserts Washington\\'s intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region. \"In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape,\" Mr. Baker said. \"The U.S., with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in designing its architecture.\" \\n\\nBut maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.\\nJapan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).\\nMoreover, the Japanese government, now the world\\'s largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is.\\nWhile U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan\\'s enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. \"There\\'s an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions\" in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. \"If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone.\" \\n\\nSome Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington\\'s demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region.\\nThe issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.\\'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.\\nMany Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence. \\n\\n\"No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home,\" Mr. Hormats says. \\n\\nFor their part, Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut. \\n\\n\"They don\\'t want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up,\" says Chong-sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nCathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes.\\nWhile giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets. \\n\\nShe had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny. \"A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance. . . . At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan. . . . The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms.\" \\n\\nVirtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.\\nIn fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.\\nThe student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest. \"My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test,\" he said. \\n\\nThe teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.\\nConfronted, Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.\\nShe had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.\\nIn September, she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine.\\nHer alternative was 90 days in jail. \\n\\nHer story is partly one of personal downfall.\\nShe was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students, but she will probably never teach again.\\nIn her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin\\'s case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.\\nThe 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina\\'s school-improvement laws.\\nProsecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students\\' scores to win a bonus under the state\\'s 1984 Education Improvement Act.\\nThe bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores. \\n\\n\"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores,\" says Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College. \"So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise.\" And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing. \\n\\nA 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school-research group, concluded that \"outright cheating by American educators\" is \"common.\" The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often \"teach the test\" as Mrs. Yeargin did, although most are never caught. \\n\\nEvidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.\\nCalifornia\\'s education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.\\nAfter numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices. \\n\\nAnd sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.\\nThese materials, including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. \\'s Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.\\nBy using them, teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate, and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.\\nUse of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin\\'s school district. \\n\\nExperts say there isn\\'t another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina. \\n\\nUnder the state\\'s Education Improvement Act, low test scores can block students\\' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching, state-supervised \"interventions\" that can mean firings.\\nHigh test scores, on the other hand, bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school, grants for special projects, a bonus for the superintendent. \\n\\nAnd South Carolina says it is getting results.\\nSince the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.\\nCritics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much.\\nFriends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.\\nSays the organization\\'s founder, John Cannell, prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is \"a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don\\'t take it seriously at all.\" \\n\\nPaul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says Mr. Cannell\\'s allegations of cheating \"are purely without foundation,\" and based on unfair inferences.\\nPartly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring. \\n\\nSouth Carolina\\'s reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School.\\nStanding on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina\\'s best and brightest, including the state\\'s last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.\\nBut by the early 1980s, its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade. \\n\\n\"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class,\" says Linda Ward, the school\\'s principal. \"Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs.\" \\n\\nMrs. Ward took over in 1986, becoming the school\\'s seventh principal in 15 years.\\nHer immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.\\nPrior to his term, a teacher bled to death in the halls, stabbed by a student.\\nAcademically, Mrs. Ward says, the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run-down, inner city neighborhoods. \\n\\nMrs. Ward resolved to clean out \"deadwood\" in the school\\'s faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.\\nOne was statewide school reform, which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.\\nAnother was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward. \\n\\n\"Being a teacher just became my life,\" says the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin, a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal. \"I loved the school, its history.\\nI even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students.\" \\n\\nWhile Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum, Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.\\nIn 1986-87 and 1987-88, she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law.\\nEncouraged by Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state \"teacher cadet\" program, a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.\\nShe won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new \"Cultural Literacy\" class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as \"Teacher of the Year.\" \\n\\n\"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together,\" says Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.\\nShe says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.\\nMary Beth Marchand, a Greenville 11th grader, also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education. \"She taught us more in Western Civilization than I\\'ve ever learned in other classes,\" says Kelli Green, a Greenville senior. \\n\\nIn the classroom, students say, Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions.\\nOn weekends, she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes, even to polish the furniture in her classroom. \\n\\n\"She just never gave it up,\" says Mary Marchand, Mary Beth\\'s mother. \"You\\'d see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game.\" \\n\\nSome fellow teachers, however, viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.\\nMrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander.\\nPressures began to build.\\nFriends told her she was pushing too hard.\\nBecause of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin\\'s extra work was also helping her earn points in the state\\'s incentive-bonus program.\\nBut the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.\\nHuge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000. \\n\\nWinning a bonus for a third year wasn\\'t that important to her, Mrs. Yeargin insists.\\nBut others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money, then for pride and recognition.\\nMary Elizabeth Ariail, another social-studies teacher, says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn\\'t demand good hearing.\\nIndeed, Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program. \\n\\nLast March, after attending a teaching seminar in Washington, Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn\\'t prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.\\nWhen test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time, she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct. \"I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation,\" she says. \"Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.\\nThe rest were history, sociology, finance -- subjects they never had.\" \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School\\'s overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.\\nMostly, she says, she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test. \"These kids broke my heart,\" she says. \"A whole day goes by and no one even knows they\\'re alive.\\nThey desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them, who loved them.\\nThe last thing they needed was another drag-down blow.\" \\n\\nSchool officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying.\\nThey found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn\\'t tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly. \"That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child,\" says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of Greenville High School\\'s alumni association.\\nMrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class, adding: \"I wanted to help all\" students. \\n\\nMr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair. \"Do I have much sympathy for her?\" Mr. Watson asks. \"Not really.\\nI believe in the system.\\nI believe you have to use the system to change it.\\nWhat she did was like taking the law into your own hands.\" \\n\\nMrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered, she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring.\\nShe says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate.\\nMrs. Yeargin declined. \"She said something like `You just want to make it easy for the school. \\' I was dumbfounded,\" Mrs. Ward recalls. \"It was like someone had turned a knife in me.\" \\n\\nTo the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.\\nThe school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students, teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.\\nSupportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared. \\n\\nThe show didn\\'t give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin\\'s offense, saying only that she helped students do better on the test. \"The message to the board of education out of all this is we\\'ve got to take a serious look at how we\\'re doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state,\" said the talk-show host.\\nEditorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong, but also said the case showed how testing was being overused. \\n\\nThe radio show \"enraged us,\" says Mrs. Ward.\\nPartly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.\\nAnd legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.\\nOver 50 witnesses, mostly students, were interviewed. \\n\\nAt Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed. \"It\\'s hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go,\" says Mrs. Ward.\\nSoon, T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school\\'s familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front.\\nOn the back, the shirts read, \"We have all the answers.\" Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. \"She did a lot of harm,\" says Cathryn Rice, who had discovered the crib notes. \"We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us.\" \\n\\nBut several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.\\nSays Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher, \"The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.\\nThere may be others doing what she did.\" \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement, and because she was afraid of further charges.\\nMrs. Ward, for one, was relieved.\\nDespite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin, popular sentiment was so strong in her favor, Mrs. Ward says, that \"I\\'m afraid a jury wouldn\\'t have convicted her.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nSince chalk first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted to know: What\\'s on the test?\\nThese days, students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests. \\n\\nThe mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: \"What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?\" It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths. \\n\\nWorksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials, sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.\\nIn many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.\\nWhat\\'s more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan\\'s parent, Britain\\'s Maxwell Communication Corp. \\n\\nClose parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say.\\nTest-preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.\\nBut some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating. \\n\\n\"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I\\'d have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn\\'t cheating,\" says John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who has studied test coaching.\\nHe and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress. \\n\\n\"It\\'s as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history,\" says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing. \\n\\nStandardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.\\nThe most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw\\'s CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. \\'s Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test. \\n\\nSales figures of the test-prep materials aren\\'t known, but their reach into schools is significant.\\nIn Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say they are common classroom tools. \\n\\nMacmillan/McGraw says \"well over 10 million\" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.\\nAbout 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers\\' binders have also been sold in the past four years.\\nThe materials in each set reach about 90 students.\\nScoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests. \\n\\nMichael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn\\'t aimed at improving test scores.\\nHe also asserted that exact questions weren\\'t replicated.\\nWhen referred to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental. \\n\\nMr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn\\'t be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.\\nThey devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT. \\n\\nBecause many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn\\'t replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.\\nBut Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.\\nScoring High matched on 64.5. \\n\\nIn CAT sections where students\\' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know. \\n\\nLearning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items. \\n\\nRick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs.\\nKaminski and Mehrens are ignoring \"the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format.\" He said authors of Scoring High \"scrupulously avoid\" replicating exact questions, but he doesn\\'t deny that some items are similar. \\n\\nWhen Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.\\nMcGraw-Hill was outraged.\\nIn a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn\\'t be used because it represented a \"parallel form\" of the CAT and CTBS tests.\\nBut in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.\\nMessrs.\\nBrownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nAlleghany Corp. said it completed the

moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants. \\n\\nMedical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s and Huntington\\'s.\\nBut anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions. \\n\\nJames Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research \"should be continued indefinitely.\" He said the ban won\\'t stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn\\'t involve transplants. \\n\\nDepartment officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason\\'s ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.\\nBoth Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush, except in cases where a woman\\'s life is threatened. \\n\\nThe controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson\\'s disease.\\nThe department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues. \\n\\nA majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.\\nThe dispute has hampered the administration\\'s efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. \\n\\nSeveral candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants.\\nAntonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.\\nDr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \\n\\nSome researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.\\nEarlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by \"standards of scientific and administrative excellence,\" not politics. \\n\\nBut the administration\\'s handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. \"When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications,\" says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School. \"The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists\" for finding a middle ground. \\n\\nYale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.\\nBut Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason\\'s ruling may discourage private funding. \"The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don\\'t provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support,\" he said. \\n\\nDespite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts. \"Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer\" or to regulate genes that cause Down\\'s syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.\\nThe NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nRekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq\\'s bank stocks, but the over-the-counter

financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios, making them unattractive takeover targets. \\n\\nBut speculators, anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon, immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news. \"A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick,\" said George Jennison, head

Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \"The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government,\" added Mr. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail. \\n\\nMr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who don\\'t have domestic bank accounts.\\nThese individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers.\\nMr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn\\'t want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers.\\nFilling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said.\\nThe defense lawyers\\' group formed a task force this week, chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt, to deal with the matter. \\n\\nThe American Bar Association\\'s House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement.\\nMichael Ross, a New York lawyer who heads the ABA\\'s grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA\\'s code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death. \\n\\nMr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department, which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, to discuss the issue last May.\\nAt that meeting, he said, the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures wouldn\\'t be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice.\\nMr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department\\'s moderate stance on the matter. \\n\\nBut in the letters sent in recent days, Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit, told attorneys that \"failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated.\" In some cases, the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985. \\n\\nA spokesman for the IRS confirmed that \"there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s,\" but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now.\\nIndividuals familiar with the Justice Department\\'s policy said that Justice officials hadn\\'t any knowledge of the IRS\\'s actions in the last week. \\n\\nLawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.\\nProsecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.\\nBut they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases. \\n\\nSome criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue.\\nIn a number of recent cases, federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys\\' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential. \\n\\nTHE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim. \\n\\nOften, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento, Calif.\\nOn Tuesday, the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm.\\nThe reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise. \\n\\n\"A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years, and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan,\" the judge quipped in an interview.\\nFederal judges make $89,500 annually; in February, Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50%. \\n\\nJudge Ramirez, 44, said it is unjust for judges to make what they do. \"Judges are not getting what they deserve.\\nYou look around at professional ballplayers or accountants . . . and nobody blinks an eye.\\nWhen you become a federal judge, all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum.\" \\n\\nAt his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, he will make out much better. \\n\\nThe judge declined to discuss his salary in detail, but said: \"I\\'m going to be a high-priced lawyer.\" \\n\\nDOONESBURY CREATOR\\'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter. \\n\\nCartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $11 million, alleging it mounted a \"campaign to harass and punish\" him for crossing a screenwriters\\' picket line. \\n\\nThe dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc., a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner.\\nMr. Trudeau, a Writers Guild member, also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse, which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement. \\n\\nThe guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988.\\nIn his lawsuit, Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse, and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company.\\nA spokesman for the guild said the union\\'s lawyers are reviewing the suit.\\nHe said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau. \\n\\nMr. Trudeau\\'s attorney, Norman K.

Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer. \"In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear.\" As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and \"make appropriate reductions\" in operating expenses. \\n\\nThe $35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share.\\nNot counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share.\\nA year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share.\\nRevenue rose 42% to $133.7 million from $94 million. \\n\\nThe charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.\\nRelated to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, Calif., factory to a research and development facility.\\nA spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force. \\n\\n\"This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned,\" said Michael Stark, chip analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co. \"I think the stock is dead money for a while.\" Yesterday\\'s announcement was made after markets closed. \\n\\nU.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer.\\nPart of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nINGERSOLL-RAND Co.

\\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday, buoyed by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues. \\n\\nWhile market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark. \\n\\nAt the same time, dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks, in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark\\'s strength, resulting in a stalemate. \\n\\nJay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds. \\n\\n\"Dollar-yen {trade} is the driving force in the market,\" said Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, \"but I\\'m not convinced it will continue.\\nWho knows what will happen down the road, in three to six months, if foreign investment starts to erode?\" \\n\\nIn late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks, up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday, and at 143.80 yen, up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday.\\nSterling was quoted at $1.5755, down from $1.5805 late Tuesday. \\n\\nIn Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday\\'s Tokyo close of 143.08 yen. \\n\\nDouglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar\\'s recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings. \\n\\nHe contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. \\'s announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified.\\nHe cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence. \\n\\nThe forthcoming maturity in November of a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison. \\n\\nIt remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over. \\n\\nMeanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions. \\n\\nThey point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede. \\n\\nThe market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators. \\n\\nDealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers\\' report.\\nThe managers\\' index, which measures the health of the manufacturing sector, stood at 47.6% in October, above September\\'s 46%, and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3%. \\n\\nSome dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50, which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.\\nBut most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade. \\n\\nOn the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $374.20 an ounce, down 50 cents.\\nEstimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces. \\n\\nIn early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $374.19 an ounce.

the network. \\n\\nBut some of the TV stations that bought \"Cosby\" reruns for record prices two years ago aren\\'t laughing much these days.\\nThe reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows.\\nBut the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire. \\n\\nMeanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say, the show\\'s distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing \"Cosby\" to a competitor.\\nAt the same time, Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to \"A Different World,\" a spin-off of \"Cosby\" whose reruns will become available in 1991. \\n\\nViacom denies it\\'s using pressure tactics. \"We\\'re willing to negotiate,\" says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing. \"We\\'re offering this plan now because we feel it\\'s the right time.\" \\n\\nBut, says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest, \"I think if I tell them I need more time, they\\'ll take `Cosby\\' across the street,\" \\n\\nViacom\\'s move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks.\\nOne station manager says he believes Viacom\\'s move is a \"pre-emptive strike\" because the company is worried that \"Cosby\" ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years. \"Cosby\" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. \\n\\nMr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising. \\n\\nAnd executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew \"Cosby.\" Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has \"been a major disappointment to us.\" \"At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar.\\nThere wasn\\'t.\" \\n\\nNeil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says \"Cosby\" gets the station\\'s highest ratings and he\\'s \"pleased.\" But he adds, \"I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with Viacom.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei. \\n\\nDavid Wu, the company\\'s representative in Taiwan, said Atlanta-based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life-insurance products. \\n\\nLife of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based in the Netherlands. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nIn this era of frantic competition for ad dollars, a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.\\nSo can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers? \\n\\nGarbage magazine, billed as \"The Practical Journal for the Environment,\" is about to find out. \\n\\nFounded by Brooklyn, N.Y., publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore, Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis.\\nThe magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting, explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet, and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders. \\n\\nGarbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America\\'s good guys and bad boys.\\nIn one feature, called \"In the Dumpster,\" editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender.\\nFrom an advertising standpoint, the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days. \\n\\nWith only two issues under its belt, Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others.\\nCampbell Soup, for one, is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere \"In the Dumpster\" column.\\nThe magazine\\'s editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging\\'s polystyrene foam, polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable. \"It\\'s precisely the kind of product that\\'s created the municipal landfill monster,\" the editors wrote. \\n\\n\"I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage, but it is practicing journalistic garbage,\" fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup.\\nHe says Campbell wasn\\'t even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment.\\nModifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed, he says, making it less an offender than was portrayed.\\nHe admits, though, it isn\\'t one of Campbell Soup\\'s better products in terms of recyclability. \\n\\nCampbell Soup, not surprisingly, doesn\\'t have any plans to advertise in the magazine, according to its spokesman. \\n\\nSome media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue\\'s big spenders. \"You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you\\'re going to make a run of it,\" says Mike White, senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham, Chicago. \"The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base\" of big-time ad spenders, he adds. \\n\\nThe first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including General Electric and Adolph Coors, but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International, firms that don\\'t spend much money advertising and can\\'t be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul. \\n\\nA Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase, and it doesn\\'t have any plans to advertise in future issues. \"We don\\'t spend much on print advertising,\" she says. \\n\\nBut Ms. Poore, the magazine\\'s editor and publisher, contends Garbage can survive, at least initially, on subscription revenues.\\nIndividual copies of the magazine sell for $2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $21. (It is, of course, printed on recycled paper.) \\n\\nAccording to Ms. Poore, Old-House Journal Corp., her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.\\nThe first and second issues sold out on newsstands, she says, and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions. \\n\\nAsked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine\\'s direct policy, Ms. Poore replies: \"I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care.\\nI\\'m not saying advertising revenue isn\\'t important,\" she says, \"but I couldn\\'t sleep at night\" if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad. \\n\\nAd Notes. . . . \\n\\nINTERPUBLIC ON TV: Interpublic Group said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990.\\nIt said the programs, largely game shows, will be provided by its E.C.

pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers. \\n\\nSea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. \\n\\nThe move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC.\\nIn May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for Sea Containers.\\nIn August, Temple sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million. \\n\\nYesterday, Sea Containers\\' chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million.\\nAbout $490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back, leaving about $130 million, he said. \\n\\nThat $130 million, Mr. Sherwood said, \"gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid.\\nWe are able to increase our price above the $70 level if necessary.\" He declined to say, however, how much Sea Containers might raise its price. \\n\\nMr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to \"substantially increase their bid if they\\'re going to top us.\" \\n\\nTemple, however, harshly criticized Sea Containers\\' plan yesterday, characterizing it as a \"highly conditional device designed to entrench management, confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer.\" \\n\\nA spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers\\' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash.\\nThe lower figures, the spokesman said, would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers\\' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market. \\n\\nTemple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} \\n\\nTemple also said Sea Containers\\' plan raises \"numerous legal, regulatory, financial and fairness issues,\" but didn\\'t elaborate. \\n\\nMr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers\\' proposal has been \"very positive.\" In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sea Containers closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe Transportation Department, responding to pressure from safety advocates, took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles. \\n\\nThe department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans, beginning with 1992 models.\\nIt also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year.\\nSuch belts already are required for the vehicles\\' front seats. \\n\\n\"Today\\'s action,\" Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said, \"represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards.\" \\n\\nIn September, the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars. \\n\\nThe Big Three auto makers said the rule changes weren\\'t surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans. \\n\\nSafety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S.\\nThey say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars. \\n\\nThey didn\\'t have much luck during the Reagan administration. \"But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem,\" said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \"We\\'re in a very different regulatory environment.\" Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) praised the department\\'s actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths. \"We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards,\" he said. \\n\\nSen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans, including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection. \\n\\nThe department\\'s roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.\\nThe roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.\\nDuring the test, the roof couldn\\'t be depressed more than five inches. \\n\\nIn Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.\\nHe said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1, 1991, deadline.\\nChrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars. \\n\\nJohn Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. \\'s auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.\\nFord began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year.\\nThe new Explorer sport-utility vehicle, set for introduction next spring, will also have the rear-seat belts.\\nMr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nConsolidated Rail Corp.

both Massachusetts and Connecticut, where most of Bank of New England\\'s operations are, allow interstate banking only within New England. \\n\\nRichard Driscoll, vice chairman of Bank of New

Guigal\\'s 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne, for example, is $120. \\n\\nNone of France\\'s wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy, however.\\nThe six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world, have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now.\\nWith the 1985 vintage, they soared higher: La Tache, $195; Richebourg, $180; Romanee-Conti, $225.\\nAnother small Burgundy estate, Coche-Dury, has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $155. \\n\\nFrom Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $125 a bottle, Piero Antinori\\'s La Solaia, a $90 Cabernet from Tuscany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $98.\\nSpain\\'s Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released only in its 10th year) is $70, as is Australia\\'s Grange Hermitage 1982. \\n\\n\"There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices,\" says Larry Shapiro of Marty\\'s, one of the largest wine shops in Dallas. \"What\\'s different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.\\nWe\\'re seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce.\" \\n\\nWine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines, Mr. Shapiro continued: \"We\\'ve seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the \\'40s and \\'50s, which go for $300 to $400 a bottle.\\nSome of the newer wines, even at $90 to $100 a bottle or so, almost offer a bargain.\" \\n\\nTake Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek.\\nIt\\'s made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.\\nOwner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $60 a bottle, but when a retailer in Southern California asked, \"Is that wholesale or retail?\" he re-thought the matter.\\nOffering the wine at roughly $65 a bottle wholesale ($100 retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it\\'s high but I\\'ll take it (2 responses); 3) I\\'ll take all I can get (58 responses).\\nThe wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states. \\n\\n\"We thought it was awfully expensive,\" said Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer\\'s in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, \"but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.\\nWe got our two six-packs -- and they\\'re gone.\" \\n\\nMr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers don\\'t like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.\\nEven if there is consumer resistance at first, a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move. \"There may be sticker-shock reaction initially,\" said Mr. Pratt, \"but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell, they eventually get excited and decide it\\'s worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people,\" added Larry Shapiro. \"They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek\\'s Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.\\nProducers have seen this market opening up and they\\'re now creating wines that appeal to these people.\" \\n\\nThat explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.\\nBut consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. \"They won\\'t buy if the quality is not there,\" said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. \"Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less.\" Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range. \\n\\nImage has, of course, a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn\\'t, and it can\\'t be forced.\\nWine merchants can\\'t keep Roederer Cristal in stock, but they have to push Salon le Mesnil, even lowering the price from $115 to $90.\\nIt\\'s hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted, people have their own ideas about value. \\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren\\'t always walking out the door.\\nIn every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy \\'86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag\\'s Leap 1985 Cask 23. \\n\\nWith the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.\\nBy January it should be fairly clear what\\'s hot -- and what\\'s not.

clear whether the central bank will do so. \\n\\nA survey by the Fed\\'s 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated. \"The economy is clearly slowing,\" says Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. \\n\\n\"If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter,\" agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey. \\n\\nNevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern. \"We\\'re coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur,\" said Mr. Guffey. \\n\\nBush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. \"I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date,\" said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co. \\n\\nThe Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since. \\n\\nThe report from the Fed found that manufacturing, in particular, has been weak in recent weeks.\\nThe Philadelphia Fed, for instance, reported that manufacturing activity \"continues to decline\" for the fourth month in a row.\\nAnd in the Chicago district, the report said, \"a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment.\" Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts, particularly \"for discretionary, big-ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics.\" And construction also was described as slow in most areas. \\n\\nDespite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.\\nAs a result, Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit.\\nSeveral Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move. \\n\\nMr. Black said he is \"pleased\" with the economy\\'s recent performance, and doesn\\'t see \"a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession.\" \\n\\n\"There is always a chance of recession,\" added Mr. Guffey, \"but if you ask me to put a percentage on it, I would think it\\'s well below a 50% chance.\"

postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling. \\n\\nMichael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled.\\nUnless it can raise money in financial markets, Mr. Basham said, the federal government won\\'t have the cash to pay off $13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday. \\n\\nWithout congressional action, the Treasury can\\'t sell any new securities -- even savings bonds.\\nBut despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes, Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default. \\n\\n\"Each day that Congress fails to act . . . will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer,\" Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers. \"To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative.\" \\n\\nThe securities to be sold next week will raise about $10 billion in cash and redeem

to mature Aug. 15, 2019.\\nThe Treasury also said it plans to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday.\\nThey will mature Dec. 21. \\n\\nNone of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said. \\n\\nThe Treasury said it needs to raise $47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $20 billion cash balance.\\nAuctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion. \\n\\nThe remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the Treasury said. \\n\\nIn the first three months of 1990, the

pressure on the commodity chemicals concern. \\n\\nThe offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share.\\nGeorgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives.\\nHowever, it hasn\\'t yet made any proposals to shareholders. \\n\\nLate

that \"discussions are being held with interested parties, and work is also continuing on other various transactions.\" It didn\\'t elaborate. \\n\\nAnalysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, won\\'t leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed. \"He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull,\" says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co. \"He appears to be in it for the long haul.\" Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf. \\n\\nMr. Simmons owns 88% of Valhi Inc., which in

Satrum, Mr. Martin asked Georgia Gulf to answer its offer by Tuesday. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again.\\nMr. Martin said they haven\\'t yet decided what their next move would be, but he didn\\'t rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf\\'s board.\\nIn other transactions, Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer. \\n\\nAlthough Georgia Gulf hasn\\'t been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the company\\'s management is interested in some kind of transaction.\\nThe management group owns about 18% of the stock, most purchased at nominal prices, and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold. \\n\\nIn the third quarter, Georgia Gulf earned $46.1 million, or $1.85 a share, down from $53 million, or $1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding.\\nSales fell to $251.2 million from $278.7 million. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nA licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine. \\n\\nUniversity Patents Inc., based in Westport, Conn., said it seeks Johnson & Johnson\\'s profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere. \\n\\nIn May, University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M.

Boone Pickens Jr.\\nThe Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2% stake valued at more than $1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company, Koito Manufacturing Co.\\nBut he has failed to gain any influence at the company.\\nKoito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board, asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito\\'s other shareholders into buying him out at a profit. \\n\\nMr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan.\\nThe Senate Finance Committee, chaired by a fellow Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens\\'s experience in talks with Tokyo \"to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets.\" \\n\\nWhile Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors\\' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public\\'s attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week\\'s talks.\\nAmong them are differences in savings and investment rates, corporate structures and management, and government spending.\\nEach side has a litany of recommendations for the other. \\n\\nThe U.S. says it is anxious for results. \"We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we\\'ve identified, and we need it by next spring,\" Mr. Dallara says. \\n\\nBoth sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed.\\nBut they haven\\'t clarified what those might be. \\n\\nAfter the first set of meetings two months ago, some U.S. officials complained that Japan hadn\\'t come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.\\nThe Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions. \\n\\n\"Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn\\'t mean anything,\" says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official. \"We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it.\" \\n\\nThat process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time, the Japanese say, no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results.\\nFor instance, at the first meeting the two sides couldn\\'t even agree on basic data used in price discussions.\\nSince then, a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.\\nBy Monday, they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust. \\n\\n\"Little by little, there is progress,\" says the MITI official. \"Both sides are taking action.\" \\n\\nElisabeth Rubinfien contributed to this article. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nWhile worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S., Japan\\'s big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America\\'s smaller business. \\n\\nFor Japan, the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology.\\nBut for small American companies, it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help. \\n\\nTake the deal with Candela Laser Corp., a Wayland, Mass., manufacturer of high-tech medical devices, which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market.\\nPartly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co., one of Japan\\'s largest trading companies, for investment. \\n\\nIn a joint-venture deal, Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo\\'s bureaucratic maze.\\nIt eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.\\nAt last count, Candela had sold $4 million of its medical devices in Japan. \\n\\nThe deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product. \"They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach,\" says Richard Olsen, a Candela vice president.\\nIndeed, for many Japanese trading companies, the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use. \\n\\nThe Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas, frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks won\\'t touch.\\nJapanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years, but in recent months, the pace has taken off. \\n\\nIn the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports Venture Economics Inc.\\nThe Needham, Mass., concern tracks investments in new businesses.\\nIn addition, of course, some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms. \\n\\nHeightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.

Sullivan, who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C. \"This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today\\'s rate-sensitive customers costly.\" \\n\\nPackages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.\\nFor their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.\\nThe more accounts customers have, Mr. Sullivan says, the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it.\\nThat can pay off down the road as customers, especially the younger ones, change from borrowers to savers/investors. \\n\\nPackaging has some drawbacks.\\nThe additional technology, personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.\\nChemical Bank spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing. \"It\\'s not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay,\" Mr. Jacob says. \\n\\nStill, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs. \"These days, banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them,\" Ms. Moore says.\\nSome banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T. Sale, marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte.\\nFirst Union, he says, now has packages for seven customer groups.\\nSoon, it will split those into 30. \\n\\nSays Mr. Sale: \"I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store, not the boutique.\" \\n\\nIRAs. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nSHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.\\nThe Chandler, Ariz., company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.\\nCurrently, ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding.\\nShareData develops and markets low-cost software, peripheral equipment and accessories for computers. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nFive things you can do for $15,000 or less: \\n\\n1.\\nBuy a new Chevrolet. \\n\\n2.\\nTake a Hawaiian vacation. \\n\\n3.\\nSend your child to a university. \\n\\n4.\\nBuy a diamond necklace. \\n\\n5.\\nMake a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan. \\n\\nAmericans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they don\\'t think much about it.\\nBut for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise. \\n\\nYour $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit. \\n\\nAs a Foster Corporate Parent, you\\'ll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.\\nLike healthy regulatory capital.\\nA steady deposit base.\\nPerforming loans.\\nAt the same time, you\\'ll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good. \\n\\nAs a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.\\nThat builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth. \\n\\nDon\\'t wait -- a savings institution needs your help now!

Edward Markey (D., Mass.), by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers. \\n\\n\"Markey said we could have done this in public\" because so little sensitive information was disclosed, the aide said.\\nMr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel, the aide added. \\n\\nAt another point during the hearing, Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today.\\nMr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue.\\nThat response annoyed Rep. Markey, House aides said, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter. \\n\\nFifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing, most notably Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months. \\n\\nMr. Dingell expressed concern, sources said, about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading, which uses futures to offset stock trades.\\nThe futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English, and, like most English peculiarities, unintelligible to the rest of the world. \\n\\n-- Dorothy L. Sayers, \"The Nine Tailors\" \\n\\nASLACTON, England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong. \\n\\nThe parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as members here always have.\\nIn the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614. \\n\\nBut there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can\\'t be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening. \\n\\nLike most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own \"band\" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.\\nNow, only one local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond. \\n\\nThe others here today live elsewhere.\\nThey belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia. \\n\\n\"To ring for even one service at this tower, we have to scrape,\" says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker. \"We\\'ve tried to train the youngsters, but they have their discos and their dances, and they just drift away.\" \\n\\nMr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.\\nHistory, after all, is not on his side.\\nAccording to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England\\'s church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them. \\n\\nIt is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes.\\nThe less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.\\nChange-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago, requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration. \\n\\nProper English bells are started off in \"rounds,\" from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.\\nThen, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.\\nEach variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state.\\nRingers memorize patterns of changes, known as \"methods,\" which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.\\nA series of 5,000 or so changes is a \"peal\" and takes about three hours. \\n\\nA look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved.\\nTen shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter\\'s stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.\\nNo one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.\\nTotally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it \"rope-sight\") to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls. \\n\\nFar above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.\\nSkilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change. \\n\\nIn a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a \"passion {that} finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.\" Ringers, she added, are \"filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed.\" \\n\\n\"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession,\" admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England\\'s best female ringers. \\n\\nIt is a passion that usually stays in the tower, however.\\nMore often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.\\nWhen their changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, leaving worship for others below. \\n\\nThis does not sit well with some clerics.\\nWith membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.\\nTwo years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn\\'t attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest. \"They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises,\" the Vicar Hummerstone says. \\n\\nAn entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.\\nBut there still aren\\'t enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells. \\n\\nAt St. Mary\\'s Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.\\nThe vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to talk about it, saying it would \"reopen the wound.\" But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar. \"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer,\" he says. \\n\\nVicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself. \"The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church,\" he says. \"I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life.\" \\n\\nThe Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.\\nIt hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, \"The Bells in Your Care.\" Says Mr. Baldwin, \"We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience.\" \\n\\nMr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.\\nOne survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.\\nAlso, ringers don\\'t always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches. \\n\\nBut the council\\'s program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says Mr. Baldwin. \"Right now, we\\'re lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10,\" he adds. \\n\\nOne bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.\\nThey aren\\'t accepted everywhere, however.\\nThe oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that\\'s particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain\\'s most prestigious churches, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. \\n\\nThis being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to \"The Ringing World,\" a weekly newspaper for ringers.\\nOne writer, signing his letter as \"Red-blooded, balanced male,\" remarked on the \"frequency of women fainting in peals,\" and suggested that they \"settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings.\" \\n\\nIn the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that \"the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals.\" Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing, \"I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.\\nI have seen one or two men die, bless them.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nInvestors unsettled by the stock market\\'s gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.\\nThat has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10%. \\n\\nBut don\\'t breathe too easy: Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices, some analysts warn. \\n\\nIn the past, they say, the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over. \\n\\nThat can be a trap for unwary investors, says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Strong dividend growth, he says, is \"the black widow of valuation\" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating. \\n\\nStephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time. \"Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments,\" he says. \"And recessionary environments aren\\'t hospitable to the stock market.\" \\n\\nIndeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks.\\nIn 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before.\\nThe S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977 -- despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year. \\n\\nThat pattern hasn\\'t always held, but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.\\nPayouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to Standard & Poor\\'s Corp., and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14%.\\nMany people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year, although a minority see double-digit gains continuing. \\n\\nMeanwhile, many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag: While dividends have risen smartly, their expansion hasn\\'t kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.\\nAs a result, the market\\'s dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards. \\n\\nPut another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.\\nThey are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500.\\nThe figure is currently about 3.3%, up from 3.2% before the recent market slide.\\nSome analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3%. \\n\\nA drop below that 3% benchmark \"has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued,\" says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price. \\n\\nIn fact, \"the market has always tanked.\\nAlways.\\nThere\\'s never been an exception,\" says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data. \\n\\nThe last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% was in the summer of 1987.\\nStockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle. \\n\\nThere have been only seven other times -- in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months, Mr. Perritt found.\\nAnd in each case, he says, a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year. \\n\\nStill, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn\\'t as troublesome as it might have been in years past. \"It\\'s not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner,\" says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer. \\n\\nIn particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.\\nSo, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength. \\n\\nRather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.\\nHe factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.\\nThat is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says. \\n\\nWhat will happen to dividend growth next year?\\nCommon wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits. \\n\\nPaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.\\nIn other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1% , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger. \\n\\nThe minority argument, meanwhile, is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken. \\n\\nDividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.\\nThose dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures. \\n\\nOne indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor\\'s of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.\\nA total of 139 companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said Wednesday.\\nThat followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace. \\n\\nWhile the S&P tally doesn\\'t measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year. \\n\\nIn any case, opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.\\nMr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a \"cash rate of return\" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak. \\n\\nBut Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn\\'t think it will help the overall market all that much. \"Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don\\'t think it\\'s a main consideration,\" he says.\\nWith slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year, \"I wouldn\\'t look for the market to have much upside from current levels.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nYour Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell\\'s offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. \\n\\nSuch is hardly the case.\\nBell\\'s father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York.\\nThis is where Bell\\'s patents went. \\n\\nWestern Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business.\\nIt acquired Thomas Edison\\'s microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Union\\'s Edison patent.\\nWhen Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison\\'s application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company\\'s current plight. \\n\\nOliver Berliner \\n\\nBeverly Hills, Calif. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nTroubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations. \\n\\nThe ailing company, which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters, said it won\\'t manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force. \\n\\nAltogether, NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters, 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters.\\nThe company\\'s work force will fall to about 400 people. \\n\\nStephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said customers weren\\'t willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company\\'s financial troubles.\\nFurther, he said, the company doesn\\'t have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two. \\n\\n\"We flat ran out of financing resources,\" Mr. Jerritts said. \"We had to do something structurally and radically different.\" \\n\\nAs a result, he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems, trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, using some of the applications it developed for its hardware.\\nThe company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called Legend. \\n\\nThe company, which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock, said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash. \\n\\nIn New York Stock

rapprochement between Beijing and Washington.\\nBut the former U.S. president\\'s sixth visit to China, during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders, was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship. \\n\\nMr. Nixon, the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing\\'s bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.\\nThe Chinese, in turn, took aim at American \"interference\" in China\\'s domestic affairs. \\n\\nOne official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized Mr. Nixon, who is normally referred to here as an \"old friend.\" The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of \"peaceful evolution,\" a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere. \\n\\nThe tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon\\'s final banquet toast, normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.\\nInstead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven\\'t forgiven China\\'s leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. \\n\\n\"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified,\" Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who was directly involved in ordering the attack. \"The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China.\" \\n\\nThe Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.\\nIn talks with Mr. Nixon, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.\\nIn a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, told Mr. Nixon, \"Frankly speaking, the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago.\\nChina was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it.\" \\n\\nDespite the harsh exchanges, the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations, which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as \"the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations\" since his initial visit to China 17 years ago.\\nIn his return toast to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a \"stalemate.\" \\n\\nRelations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.\\nShortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks. \\n\\nMr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.\\nMr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, before coming to China on Saturday.\\nAnd he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said.\\nMr. Nixon was to leave China today. \\n\\nAccording to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials.\\nThese included China\\'s economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.\\nMr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a U.S. government-funded academic exchange.\\nChina pulled out of the program in July. \\n\\nIn his talks, the former president urged China\\'s leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas. \"Ideas are going over borders, and there\\'s no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down,\" he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday. \\n\\nThere are no signs, however, of China\\'s yielding on key issues.\\nBut in one minor matter, Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession.\\nIn a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday, Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he wouldn\\'t encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy. \\n\\nSure enough, when he arrived at the embassy two days later, the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months.\\nA few blocks away, at the U.S. ambassador\\'s residence, the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June. \\n\\nBut the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.\\nMoreover, police and soldiers continue to harass Americans, who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week.\\nSeveral times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.\\nThe rifles weren\\'t loaded. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nYour Oct. 6

president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes \"the `money worship\\' among young people . . . caused the problem.\" He is just passing the buck to young people.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with asking for more money?\\nMoney is not everything, but it is necessary, and business is not volunteer work.\\nIt is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages.\\nI get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful.\\nI visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them. \\n\\nMany of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not changing people\\'s perceptions. \\n\\nIf the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things to improve the situation: raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan. \\n\\nHiroshi Asada \\n\\nWashington \\n\\n.START \\n\\nIn reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article \"Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President,\"

(Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.) \\n\\nBoth Deryck C. Maughan, who heads Salomon in Tokyo, and John S. Wadsworth, who heads Morgan Stanley there, ascribe a good part of their firms\\' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated, futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.\\nThey don\\'t have plans to cut back. \\n\\n\"It has not been disruptive in the markets here,\" Mr. Maughan said. \"The real difference seems to be that the cash market here . . . is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn\\'t having the same impact it does in America.\" \\n\\nThe British also are scrutinizing program trades.\\nIndex-arbitrage trading is \"something we want to watch closely,\" an official at London\\'s Stock Exchange said. \"We don\\'t think there is cause for concern at the moment.\" \\n\\nLondon serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks.\\nMarket professionals said London has several attractions. \\n\\nFirst, the trading is done over the counter and isn\\'t reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes.\\nSecond, it can be used to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins, but at prices pegged to the previous session\\'s Big Board close.\\nIn addition to the extra privacy of these trades, the transactions can often be less expensive to execute, because the parties don\\'t have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist\\'s fee. \\n\\nStill, \"Much less {index-arbitrage activity} is done over here than in the U.S.\" said Richard Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co., which manages about #15 billion ($23.72 billion) in United Kingdom institutional funds. \\n\\nBritain has two main index-arbitrage instruments.\\nA Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange\\'s Traded Options Market.\\nAnd an FT-SE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.\\nBoth contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash. \\n\\nThe average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract\\'s launch in 1984.\\nThis year, the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118, up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984. \\n\\nBut a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index-options trading was only 15% of the size of the underlying equity market, exchange officials said.\\nThis compares with estimates that the U.S. \"derivatives\" market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush. \\n\\nThe vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.\\nAdvocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs. \\n\\nBut the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise. \\n\\nSo both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65.\\nUnder the measure passed yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 next April. \\n\\nThe Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it. \\n\\n\"There are no smiles about this bill,\" Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) said during House floor debate yesterday.\\nBut \"because it\\'s all we\\'ve got, I\\'m going to vote for it.\" \\n\\nWhile the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said. \\n\\nBut Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the House\\'s acceptance of a new youth \"training\" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years.\\nAdopting a training-wage policy means \"getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage,\" Mrs. Roukema said. \\n\\nPolicy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force. \\n\\nLabor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence.\\nThe compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991. \\n\\nEmployers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers.\\nThe training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old. \\n\\nThe White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job. \\n\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 \"will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nZenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period. \\n\\nRockwell International Corp. won a $130.7 million Air Force contract for AC-130U gunship replacement aircraft. \\n\\nMartin Marietta Corp. was given a $29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment. \\n\\nFederal Data Corp. got a $29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nFor six years, T.

Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction Mr. Hahn hasn\\'t faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which were negotiated behind the scenes. \\n\\nSo far, Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough. \"We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction,\" he says. \\n\\nBut a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war, with all that implies.\\nIf a competitor enters the game, for example, Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival. \\n\\nGiven that choice, associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold. \\n\\n\"There\\'s a price above which I\\'m positive Marshall has the courage not to pay,\" says A.D. Correll, Georgia-Pacific\\'s executive vice president for pulp and paper.\\nSays long-time associate Jerry Griffin, vice president, corporate development, at WTD Industries Inc.: \"He isn\\'t of the old school of winning at any cost.\" \\n\\nHe also is a consensus manager, insiders say.\\nThe decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific\\'s management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll.\\nAssociates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.\\nAssuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.\\nBut he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand.\\nIn 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building. \\n\\nThat impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific\\'s chief executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute.\\nIn 1975, Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who didn\\'t believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world. \\n\\nBut Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks, demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on.\\nThe son of a physicist, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.\\nMoving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18, after spending only 2 1/2 years in college.\\nHe earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \\n\\nMr. Hahn agrees that he has a \"retentive\" memory, but friends say that\\'s an understatement.\\nThey call it \"photographic\". \\n\\nMr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific.\\nTaking over as chief executive officer in 1983, he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business.\\nMr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses, such as oil and gas and chemicals.\\nHe even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers. \\n\\nAt the same time, he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling, rather than materials for new-home construction.\\nThe idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction. \\n\\nThe formula has paid off, so far.\\nGeorgia-Pacific\\'s sales climbed to $9.5 billion last year, compared with $6 billion in 1983, when Mr. Hahn took the reins.\\nProfit from continuing operations has soared to $467 million from $75 million.\\nMr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best. \\n\\n\"The record of companies that have diversified isn\\'t all that impressive,\" he says. \\n\\nNekoosa wouldn\\'t be a diversification.\\nIt would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.\\nThe resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $13 billion. \\n\\nBut can Mr. Hahn carry it off?\\nIn this instance, industry observers say, he is entering uncharted waters.\\nSays Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at First Manhattan Co.: \"This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nA House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment. \\n\\nFor the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package. \\n\\nThe conference approved at least $55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well, and though no decision was made, both sides are committed to adding more than $200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration. \\n\\nThe agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year\\'s budget.\\nThese fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe. \\n\\nTo accommodate the additional cash assistance, the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $140 million from the Pentagon.\\nAnd though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively. \\n\\nThe action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $220 million for international population planning activities, an 11% increase over fiscal 1989.\\nThe House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant. \\n\\nIn a second area of common concern, the world environment, an additional $15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives, related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant. \\n\\nThe sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama\\'s quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market. \\n\\nPanama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.\\nAbout a quarter of this share has already been reallocated, according to the industry, but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate. \\n\\nThe potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados.\\nRep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines-backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye.\\nJamaica, wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the Philippines. \\n\\nIn separate floor action, the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990.\\nThe funding is attached to an estimated $27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights. \\n\\nThe leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House, but in recent days, the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House.\\nThe most recent example was a nearly $17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State, Justice and Commerce departments.\\nAnd after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nBeauty Takes Backseat \\n\\nTo Safety on Bridges \\n\\nEVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation\\'s old bridges need to be repaired or replaced.\\nBut there\\'s disagreement over how to do it. \\n\\nHighway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges aren\\'t strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through.\\nBut other people don\\'t want to lose the bridges\\' beautiful, sometimes historic, features. \\n\\n\"The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view,\" says Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department.\\nHe and others prefer to install railings such as the \"type F safety shape,\" a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings. \\n\\nIn Richmond, Ind., the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge.\\nGarret Boone, who teaches art at Earlham College, calls the new structure \"just an ugly bridge\" and one that blocks the view of a new park below. \\n\\nIn Hartford, Conn., the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced, the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park. \\n\\nCompromises are possible.\\nCitizens in Peninsula, Ohio, upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge\\'s floral pattern. \\n\\nSimilarly, highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road. \\n\\nTray Bon?\\nDrink Carrier \\n\\nCompetes With Cartons \\n\\nPORTING POTABLES just got easier, or so claims Scypher Corp., the maker of the Cup-Tote. \\n\\nThe Chicago company\\'s beverage carrier, meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets, resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer, only the loops hang from a web of strings.\\nThe new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once. \\n\\nInventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling.\\nLids aren\\'t even needed.\\nHe also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.\\nA few fast-food outlets are giving it a try. \\n\\nThe company acknowledges some problems.\\nA driver has to find something to hang the carrier on, so the company supplies a window hook.\\nWhile it breaks down in prolonged sunlight, it isn\\'t recyclable.\\nAnd unlike some trays, there\\'s no place for food. \\n\\nSpirit of Perestroika \\n\\nTouches Design World \\n\\nAN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides. \\n\\nAn exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities.\\nThe show runs the gamut, from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building. \\n\\nThe event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad\\'s Mutchin Institute. \\n\\nDan Droz, leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group, sees benefits all around.\\nThe Soviets, who normally have few clients other than the state, will get \"exposure to a market system,\" he says.\\nAmericans will learn more about making products for the Soviets. \\n\\nMr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose. \"In Moscow, they kept asking us things like, `Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all you need is one good one? \\'\" he says. \"They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones.\" \\n\\nSeed for Jail Solution \\n\\nFails to Take Root \\n\\nIT\\'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal: Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners.\\nIt would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures, the company says. \\n\\nBut New York state, which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage, says \"no.\" \\n\\nGrain elevators built in the 1920s and \\'30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle, the New York firm says.\\nMany are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster, yet close enough to permit family visits. \\n\\nBesides, Eggers says, grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt. \\n\\nA number of cities -- including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators, Eggers says.\\nA medium-sized one in Brooklyn, it says, could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York.\\nA spokesman for the state, however, calls the idea \"not effective or cost efficient.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer. \\n\\nThe department\\'s Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company\\'s Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.\\nOSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements. \\n\\nA second citation covering the company\\'s Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines. \\n\\nLabor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, \"The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards.\" \\n\\nOSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.\\nGerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, \"yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards.\" \\n\\n\"Particularly flagrant,\" Mrs. Dole said, \"are the company\\'s numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies.\" That settlement was in April 1987. \\n\\nA USX spokesman said the company hadn\\'t yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine. \"Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation,\" the spokesman said. \"No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees.\" \\n\\nUSX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works.\\nHe said that, if and when safety problems were identified, they were corrected. \\n\\nThe USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell.\\nHe has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year. \\n\\n\"The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants,\" said Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia.\\nUSX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. \\n\\nBefore the USX case, OSHA\\'s largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.\\nThe company is contesting the fine. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nDue to an editing error, a letter to the editor in yesterday\\'s edition from Frederick H.

John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark.) said. \\n\\nThe bill, as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline.\\nThe department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit. \\n\\nThe House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier\\'s employees, or their wages or benefits. \\n\\nRep. James Traficant (D., Ohio), said the amendment, which passed 271-147, would \"let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally.\" But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision, which he dubbed a \"special interest\" amendment, was likely to make the bill even more controversial. \\n\\nOn Tuesday, the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. \\n\\nThe provision, called the \"two-time-losers\" amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nFollow-up report: \\n\\nYou now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.\\nYou can even take notes -- extensive notes, for the Voice folks won\\'t look over your shoulder -- about what you read.\\nYou can do all this even if you\\'re not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress. \\n\\nAnd my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts. \\n\\nUntil the other day, you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world.\\nThat was the law.\\nAnd I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon. \\n\\nIt was censorship.\\nIt was outrageous.\\nAnd it was stupid. \\n\\nThe theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government shouldn\\'t propagandize its own people.\\nThat sounds neat, but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day.\\nGovernment press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, publications are all propaganda of sorts.\\nPropaganda is just information to support a viewpoint, and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue. \\n\\nThe restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd: An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform. \\n\\nIn June 1988, I wrote in this space about this issue.\\nAssuming it wasn\\'t one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door, I\\'ll review the facts. \\n\\nThe Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.\\nIt does a first-rate job.\\nIts budget$184 million -- is paid for by you.\\nBut a 1948 law barred the \"dissemination\" of that material in the U.S.\\nThe law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material, only at VOA headquarters in Washington, but it barred them from copying texts.\\nAnd, of course, there\\'s that word \"dissemination.\" \\n\\nHow\\'s that again? \"You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying,\" a Voice official explained when I asked.\\nWhat if I tune in my short-wave radio, transcribe an editorial or program, and print it in my newspaper? \"Nor are you free to reprint such material,\" I was advised. \\n\\nThat sounded a lot like censorship, so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere, I sued. \\n\\nA couple of weeks ago, I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines.\\nAt least, that\\'s the way it was reported.\\nAnd, indeed, the lawsuit was dismissed. \\n\\nBut I -- I like to think of it in terms of we, all of us -- won the point. \\n\\nFor a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling: The United States Information Agency, which runs the Voice, changed its position on three key points. \\n\\n-- The USIA said that, on reflection, of course I could print anything I could get my hands on.\\nThe word dissemination, it decided, referred only to itself. \"The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States,\" my lawyer, the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines, said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.\\nThe court noted the new USIA position but, just in case, officially found \"that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically.\" \\n\\n-- The USIA said that, on reflection, anyone could view the VOA materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute. \"The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials,\" Mr. McCormick noted. \\n\\n-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes. \"The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken,\" Mr. McCormick reported. \\n\\nI had sought, in my suit, the right to print Voice material, which had been denied me, and I had sought a right to receive the information, arguing in effect that a right to print government information isn\\'t very helpful if I have no right to get the information. \\n\\nBut the court disagreed. \"The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech,\" Judge Donald O\\'Brien ruled. \"The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press.\" \\n\\nSo now the situation is this: You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you don\\'t mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours.\\nI have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand.\\nBut neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us. \\n\\nIn an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not, this does seem odd. \\n\\nIndeed, Judge O\\'Brien ruled that \"it would be easy to conclude that the USIA\\'s position is `inappropriate or even stupid, \\'\" but it\\'s the law.\\nSo the next step, I suspect, is to try to get the law changed.\\nWe (I assume you\\'re in this with me at this point) need to get three words -- \"for examination only\" -- eliminated from the law. \\n\\nSection 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the USIA\\'s new position, all of us) \"for examination only.\" If those words weren\\'t there, the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it. \\n\\nThis is not a trivial issue. \\n\\n\"You have . . . raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions?\" a man wrote me a couple of years ago.\\nThe man was Charles Z.

Lazzaroni & Co., has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems. \\n\\nSuch problems will require considerable skill to resolve.\\nHowever, neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper has much international experience. \\n\\nMr. Baum, a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with Campbell employees, will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit.\\nMr. Harper, a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined Campbell in 1986, will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge. \\n\\nIn an joint interview yesterday, both men said they would like to be the company\\'s next chief executive. \\n\\nMr. McGovern, 63, had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell\\'s mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.\\nThe board is dominated by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., who controlled about 58% of Campbell\\'s stock when he died in April.\\nIn recent months, Mr. Dorrance\\'s children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity. \\n\\nIn August, the company took a $343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan.\\nThe plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs.\\nBut analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing, especially in Europe, and there were signs that the board became impatient. \\n\\nCampbell officials said Mr. McGovern wasn\\'t available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.\\nThe company\\'s prepared statement quoted him as saying, \"The CEO succession is well along and I\\'ve decided for personal reasons to take early retirement.\" \\n\\nBut people familiar with the agenda of the board\\'s meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired. \\n\\nMr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991, \"unless I get fired.\" Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Nov. 17. \\n\\nFor fiscal 1989, Mr. McGovern received a salary of $877,663.\\nHe owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares.\\nHe will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $244,000 with certain other fringe benefits. \\n\\nDuring Mr. McGovern\\'s nine-year term as president, the company\\'s sales rose to $5.7 billion from $2.8 billion and net income increased to $274 million from $130 million, the statement said. \\n\\nMr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988. \"You\\'ve got to make the restructuring work,\" said Mr. Baum. \"You\\'ve got to make those savings now.\" \\n\\nMr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company. \"We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team,\" he said.\\nHe predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive. \\n\\nMr. Baum said the two have orders to \"focus on bottom-line profits\" and to \"take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good, what is not so good.\" Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A., the company\\'s largest division, which posted 6% unit sales growth and a 15% improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989. \"The way that we\\'ve been managing Campbell U.S.A. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company,\" Mr. Baum said. \\n\\nIn the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon, both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together. \"You\\'ve got two champions sitting right before you,\" said Mr. Baum. \"We play to win.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nWednesday, November 1, 1989 \\n\\nThe key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but don\\'t always represent actual transactions. \\n\\nPRIME RATE: 10 1/2%.\\nThe base rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks. \\n\\nFEDERAL FUNDS: 9 1/2% high, 8 3/4% low, 8 3/4% near closing bid, 9% offered.\\nReserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.\\nSource: Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.)

Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. \\n\\nA successor wasn\\'t named, which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family company, Advance Publications Inc., owns Random House.\\nAbrupt departures aren\\'t unheard of within the Newhouse empire. \\n\\nIn an interview, Mr. Bernstein said his departure \"evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that\\'s the decision I reached.\" He declined to elaborate, other than to say, \"It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.\\nSometimes you just go with your gut.\" Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor, who is to be named soon. \\n\\nMr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn\\'t unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S.\\nThe company said the publisher\\'s annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during Mr. Bernstein\\'s tenure. \"Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly,\" said Mr. Newhouse. \"The company is doing well, it\\'s stable, it\\'s got good people.\\nBob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time.\" \\n\\nPublishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones haven\\'t been absorbed so easily.\\nCrown Publishing Group, acquired last year, is said to be turning in disappointing results.\\nAs a private company, Random House doesn\\'t report its earnings. \\n\\nMr. Bernstein, who succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925.\\nSpeculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.\\nPossible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine/Del Rey/ Fawcett, Random House\\'s huge and successful paperback division.\\nSome say Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen. \\n\\nThere is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb, who left Random House\\'s Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker, also owned by the Newhouse family. \\n\\nNot included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit.\\nWhen Ms. Evans took her job, several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor weren\\'t included partly because she didn\\'t wish to be a full-time administrator.\\nMr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently. \\n\\nMr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nCongress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words: \"Provided, that no funds shall be spent. . . .\" This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress.\\nIt signals Congress\\'s attempt, under the pretext of guarding the public purse, to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution. \\n\\nThis species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.\\nThe appropriations clause states that \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .\" The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.\\nThis interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report. \\n\\nAs partisans of congressional power understand, a \"power of the purse\" so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.\\nIt is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution. \\n\\nThe framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison\\'s notes.\\nTo the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability.\\nMoreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation.\\nIt would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on Congress\\'s short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress. \\n\\nAs it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public\\'s money.\\nDuring the coming weeks, President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or, alternatively, to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II, and thus void and severable. \\n\\nThe 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II. Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, \"and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S.\\nIt also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: \"The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\" \\n\\nYet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: \"No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person.\" Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president\\'s power to make recess appointments under Article II. \\n\\nSection 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president\\'s ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.\\nThe language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person\\'s salary.\\nThe president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government. \\n\\nThe 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of \"muzzling\" provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.\\nMuzzling provisions, which might be called \"blindfold laws\" as well, prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options, let alone from recommending them to Congress.\\nSuch laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress, but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations. \\n\\nTypically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.\\nProbably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president\\'s Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.\\nThere is something inherently suspect about Congress\\'s prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other. \\n\\nPerhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress\\'s attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: \"None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States.\" \\n\\nThis provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president\\'s execution of the law, since a one-house resolution could be said to be \"duly adopted\" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.\\nThe Supreme Court\\'s decision in INS v.\\nChadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional. \\n\\nPresident Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president\\'s ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.\\nIf President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.\\nWhat becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo. \\n\\nPresident Reagan learned that lesson.\\nBy 1987, then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II. \\n\\nIf a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.\\nThe Constitution does not expressly give the president such power.\\nHowever, the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution.\\nThe question is whether his only means of defense is the veto. \\n\\nExcision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president\\'s duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto.\\nAs discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.\\nThe excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.\\nOne could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers. \\n\\nThere is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.\\nIf Congress does nothing, President Bush will have won.\\nIf Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court (assuming it can establish standing to sue), President Bush might win.\\nIn that case, he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president\\'s right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive. \\n\\nIf President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v.\\nOlson was for the Reagan administration.\\nBut the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.\\nMoreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice. \\n\\nAs it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.\\nPresident Bush should set things straight.\\nIf he does not, he will help realize Madison\\'s fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature \"everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex.\" \\n\\nMr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration.\\nHis longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nDespite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year. \\n\\nThe previous record was $57.7 billion in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department. \\n\\nNet cash income -- the amount left in farmers\\' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the department\\'s Economic Research Service reported yesterday.\\nMost of those states set farm income records. \\n\\nThe worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains.\\nWhat saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had \"mortgaged\" to the government under price-support loan programs.\\nWith prices soaring, they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at \"considerable profit,\" the agency\\'s 240-page report said. \\n\\nIn less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices. \\n\\nTo the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.\\nAnalysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress. \\n\\nLast year\\'s record net cash income confirms the farm sector\\'s rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.\\nIt also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year. \\n\\nCommodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses.\\nAt the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst.\\nFarmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation\\'s cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low. \\n\\n\"All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture,\" Mr. Collins said. \\n\\nCalifornia led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion; Iowa, $3.4 billion; Florida, $3.1 billion; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion.\\nIowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income. \\n\\nDespite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.\\nMany lost their farms. \\n\\nDepartment economists don\\'t expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was.\\nIndeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.\\nAt the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets. \\n\\nLast year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion from a record $16.7 billion in 1987.\\nPayments are expected to range between $9 billion and $12 billion this year. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nAfter years of struggling, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today, shut down by its parent, Hearst Corp., following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper. \\n\\nThe demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald, once the nation\\'s largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000, turns the country\\'s second-largest city into a one-newspaper town, at least in some senses.\\nThe Los Angeles Times, with a circulation of more than 1.1 million, dominates the region.\\nBut it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register, which sells more than 300,000 copies a day, and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News, which sells more than 170,000.\\nNearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies. \\n\\nIn July, closely held Hearst, based in New York, put the paper on the block.\\nSpeculation had it that the company was asking $100 million for an operation said to be losing about $20 million a year, but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away. \\n\\nAn attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, never materialized, and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as \"tire-kickers and lookee-loos\" had filed through since.\\nThe prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun. \\n\\nThe death of the Herald, a newsstand paper in a freeway town, was perhaps inevitable.\\nLos Angeles is a sprawling, balkanized newspaper market, and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times, then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.\\nThe Herald was left in limbo. \\n\\nFurther, the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly, upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times.\\nHearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan. \\n\\nThe Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.\\nMany felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history.\\nIts fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon.\\nWilliam Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building. \\n\\nAnalysts said the Herald\\'s demise doesn\\'t necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry. \"The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age,\" said J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc. \"Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy.\" \\n\\nFounded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, the Herald was crippled by a bitter, decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.\\nFinancially, it never recovered; editorially, it had its moments.\\nIn 1979, Hearst hired editor James Bellows, who brightened the editorial product considerably.\\nHe and his successor, Mary Anne Dolan, restored respect for the editorial product, and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources, its accomplishments were notable.\\nFor example, the Herald consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley\\'s financial dealings.\\nThe Herald\\'s sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded. \\n\\nRobert J. Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, stood up in the paper\\'s newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work. \\n\\nHearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days.\\nSome long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits, the company said.\\nHours after the announcement, representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting. \\n\\nThe reaction in the newsroom was emotional. \"I\\'ve never seen so many people crying in one place at one time,\" said Bill Johnson, an assistant city editor. \\n\\n\"So Long, L.A.\" was chosen as the paper\\'s final headline. \\n\\n\"I\\'m doing the main story, and I\\'m already two beers drunk,\" said reporter Andy Furillo, whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference.\\nHis wife also works for the paper, as did his father. \\n\\nOutside, a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined \"Herald Examiner Closes\" refused to take a reader\\'s quarter. \"Forget it,\" he said as he handed her a paper. \"It doesn\\'t make any difference now.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nOlympia Broadcasting Corp. said it didn\\'t make a $1.64 million semiannual interest payment due

other financial institutions.\\nIt said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt. \\n\\nIn September, the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nIf you\\'d really rather have a Buick, don\\'t leave home without the American Express card. \\n\\nOr so the slogan might go.\\nAmerican Express Co. and General Motors Corp. \\'s beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick\\'s sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card. \\n\\nThe companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.\\nThey have begun sending letters explaining the program, which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18, to about five million card holders.\\nNeither company would disclose the program\\'s cost. \\n\\nBuick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a \"good credit history\" and are \"good at making payments,\" says a spokeswoman for the division.\\nAmerican Express also represents the upscale image \"we\\'re trying to project,\" she adds. \\n\\nBuick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as \"the doctor\\'s car\" -- a product for upscale professionals.\\nSales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier, though industry sales fell.\\nBut since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1, Buick sales have plunged 33%. \\n\\nFor American Express, the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.\\nTraditionally, the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses. \\n\\nPhillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says the promotion with Buick is his company\\'s first with an auto maker, but \"hopefully {will be} the first of many\" in the company\\'s effort to promote its green card as \"the total car-care card.\" To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card. \\n\\nMany auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says. \\n\\nUntil now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn\\'t put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the GM finance arm.\\nBut GMAC approved the Buick program, he says, because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn\\'t carry any finance rates. \\n\\nMr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick \"very sophisticated direct-mail marketers,\" so \"by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability.\" In addition, Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders, says an American Express spokeswoman.\\nWhen the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says. \\n\\nAmerican Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S., and over half have the green card.\\nGMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 who hadn\\'t \"missed any payments,\" the Buick spokeswoman says.\\nSome 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC.\\nThese 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC\\'s advertised finance rates, which start at 6.9% for two-year loan contracts. \\n\\nA spokesman for Visa International\\'s U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn\\'t have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link. \\n\\nThree divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion: the establishment services division, which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division. \\n\\nThe vacation packages include hotel

commercial banks. \\n\\nThe ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.\\nAs many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.\\nAn appeal is expected. \\n\\nIn response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.\\nGilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower. \\n\\nThe council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over #6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.\\nAt one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings. \\n\\nWhen two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates.\\nThus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments.\\nIn most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.\\nAs interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them. \\n\\nThe court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils aren\\'t vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.\\nThe council backed the audit commission\\'s stand that the swap transactions are illegal.\\nAlthough the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils. \\n\\n\"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature,\" a solicitor representing one of the banks said. \\n\\nAlready, 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings.\\nOther financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Security Pacific Corp., Chemical Banking Corp. \\'s Chemical Bank, Citicorp\\'s Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International. \\n\\nIf the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said.\\nBanks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils. \\n\\nOfficials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable.\\nThe banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nIn the aftermath of the stock market\\'s gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13, Kidder, Peabody & Co. \\'s 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country\\'s second-largest program trader. \\n\\nThe target of their wrath?\\nTheir own employer, Kidder Peabody. \\n\\nSince October\\'s minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes. \\n\\nBut the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market.\\nThe real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards.\\nProgram trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.\\nThe evidence indicates that program trading didn\\'t, in fact, cause the market\\'s sharp fall on Oct. 13, though it may have exacerbated it. \\n\\nOn one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges.\\nThese are the main proponents of program trading. \\n\\nDefending their ramparts are Wall Street\\'s Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange\\'s listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks. \\n\\nSo far, Wall Street\\'s Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle, successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors. \\n\\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading. \\n\\nStung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days.\\nA few, such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co., now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients. \\n\\nThe Old Guard\\'s assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based, in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake.\\nSome, such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman, have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators \"stop the numbers racket on Wall Street.\" \\n\\nBig Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading. \\n\\nCharles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received \"countless\" letters offering support. \"They said universally, without a single exception: Don\\'t even compromise.\\nKill it,\" he says. \\n\\nWall Street\\'s New Guard isn\\'t likely to take all this lying down for long, however.\\nIts new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.\\nProgram trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.\\nWhat\\'s more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it. \\n\\nEven some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard.\\nLast week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board\\'s most respected floor traders and head of a major traders\\' organization, surrendered.\\nHe sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines, rather than people.\\nHe said the exchange is \"headed for a real crisis\" if program trading isn\\'t curbed. \\n\\n\"I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino,\" Mr. Bradley wrote. \\n\\nThe battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations, causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee.\\nAt Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm\\'s program traders a few floors away.\\nCorporations like Contel denounce program trading, yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders. \\n\\nThe Big Board -- the nation\\'s premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives.\\nIts entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs.\\nBut the Big Board\\'s leadership -- over the specialists\\' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock \"basket\" product designed to facilitate program trading. \"A lot of people would like to go back to 1970,\" before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week. \"I would like to go back to 1970.\\nBut we are not going back to 1970.\" \\n\\nAgain and again, program-trading\\'s critics raise the \"casino\" theme.\\nThey say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation\\'s free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. \"The public didn\\'t come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that,\" says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm. \\n\\nThe program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry.\\nCritics like Mr. Murray \"are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman,\" says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. \"Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection.\" \\n\\nFor all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.\\nLike other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets. \\n\\nThat divergence is what stock index traders seek.\\nWhen it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit. \\n\\nSuch program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.\\nA program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000.\\nTo keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find. \\n\\nThe speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise. \"If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds,\" says Larry Zicklin, managing partner at Neuberger & Berman. \\n\\nBut many experts and traders say that program trading isn\\'t the main reason for stock-market gyrations. \"I have not seen one iota of evidence\" to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject.\\nSays the Big Board\\'s Mr. Phelan, \"Volatility is greater than program trading.\" \\n\\nThe Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.\\nWhile program trades swiftly kicked in, a \"circuit breaker\" that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible.\\nSusan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring \"the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility.\" Many arbs are \"overleveraged,\" she says, and they \"have to sell when things look like they fall apart.\" \\n\\nLike virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years.\\nTake the traditional money managers, or \"stock pickers,\" as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys.\\nTraditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $100 they manage for big institutional investors, and higher fees for smaller investors.\\nYet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with, much less beat, the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P \\n\\nNot surprisingly, old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500.\\nThe indexers charge only a few pennies per $100 managed.\\nToday, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds. \\n\\nThe new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms.\\nThese small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.\\nThe specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell. \\n\\nAnd they believe the Big Board, under Mr. Phelan, has abandoned their interest.\\nThe son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets. \\n\\nMeanwhile, specialists\\' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility. \"When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go\" on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there. \"The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone\" as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends. \\n\\nNo one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation\\'s stockbrokers.\\nThey are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market\\'s swings since then. \"Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death,\" says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.\\nStockbrokers\\' business and pay has been falling.\\nLast year, the average broker earned $71,309, 24% lower than in 1987. \\n\\nCorporate executives resent that their company\\'s stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.\\nIndex traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often don\\'t even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp. \"Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?\\nOh, you\\'re in the paper business,\" is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he\\'s gotten from his big institutional shareholders. \\n\\nBy this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board\\'s average daily trading volume.\\nAmong the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc.\\nBut then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard, particularly against index arbitrage.\\nThe indexers\\' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die. \"There\\'s a lynch-mob psychology right now,\" says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm. \"Wall Street\\'s cash cow has been gored, but I don\\'t think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem.\" \\n\\nToo much money is at stake for program traders to give up.\\nFor example, stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982, and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched.\\nStock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.\\nNow, on a good day, Chicago\\'s stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock. \\n\\nNow the stage is set for the battle to play out.\\nThe anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress.\\nProgram traders\\' \"power to create total panic is so great that they can\\'t be allowed to have their way,\" says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. \"We have to have a system that says to those largest investors: `Sit down! You will not panic, you will not put the financial system in jeopardy. \\'\" \\n\\nBut the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon.\\nMany people, including the Big Board, think that it\\'s too late to put the genie back in the bottle.\\nThe Big Board\\'s directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn\\'t being considered, Big Board officials say. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks,\" says Vanderbilt\\'s Prof.\\nStoll. \"Program trading is here to stay, and computers are here to stay, and we just need to understand it.\" \\n\\nShort of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don\\'t. \\n\\nOne such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the \"good-faith\" payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.\\nCurrently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative.\\nProgram trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins. \\n\\nFutures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active.\\nHigher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say. \\n\\nAnother proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an \"uptick rule\"a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.\\nThe Big Board\\'s uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price. \\n\\nBut in 1986, program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations, to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets.\\nA reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.\\nProgram traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the \"pricing efficiency\" of the futures and stock markets. \\n\\nJames A. White contributed to this article. \\n\\nFundamentalists Jihad .START \\n\\nBig Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.\\nThus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus. \\n\\nIndex arbitrage is a common form of program trading.\\nAs usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can\\'t trade them for long at prices that are widely different.\\nIn index arbitrage, the widget is the S&P 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York.\\nTo profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago. \\n\\nIf the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index, he is likely to remain fully invested at all times. (Few, if any, index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100% exposure to stocks, and equally few will want to own less than a 100% position should stocks rise.) \\n\\nBy constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget, index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1% and 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500.\\nThat represents a very thin \"excess\" return, certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective.\\nThe fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue. \\n\\nAs more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy, these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and, eventually, eliminated.\\nThe current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange\\'s attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors\\' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares. \\n\\nSo if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did \"program trading\" evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?\\nAll arguments against program trading, even those pressed without fact, conclude with three expected results after \"reforms\" are implemented: 1) reduced volatility, 2) a long-term investment focus, and 3) a level playing field for the small investor.\\nBut many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful. \\n\\nReducing volatility.\\nAn index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs.\\nArbitrage doesn\\'t cause volatility; it responds to it.\\nThink about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago. \\n\\nA large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures.\\nArbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York, while functioning as a buyer in Chicago.\\nThe start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move. \\n\\nWhy does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?\\nPerhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.\\nIn a competitive market, this investor has many ways to execute his transactions, and he will have more alternatives (both foreign and domestic) if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle.\\nIf not Chicago, then in New York; if not the U.S., then overseas. \\n\\nVolatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.\\nEliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.\\nThe speed of his transaction isn\\'t to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.\\nIf slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future. \\n\\nEncouraging long-term investing.\\nWe must be very cautious about labeling investors as \"long-term\" or \"short-term.\" Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board\\'s door saying: \"Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!\" The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.\\nA free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate. \\n\\nIn point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.\\nPeriods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example).\\nIt is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream \"foul\" on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise.\\nCould rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins? \\n\\nSome of the proposed fixes for what is labeled \"program-trading volatility\" could be far worse than the perceived problem.\\nIn using program trading as a whipping boy, fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.\\nThey may, however, risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.\\nHow does a nice new tax, say 5%, on any financial transaction sound?\\nThat ought to make sure we\\'re all thinking for the long term. \\n\\nGetting a level playing field.\\nThis argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause.\\nThe loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.\\nThey continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell, while their clients continue to hope for superior performance.\\nEven with mutual funds, the little investor continues to tolerate high fees, high commissions and poor performance, while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees, lower commissions and less risk.\\nYet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows. \\n\\nAlmost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy, and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences. \\n\\nIf spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous, surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors.\\nThe sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first, while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.\\nCost-effective index funds just aren\\'t sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay, and that institutional customers refuse to pay. \\n\\nEach new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients, here or overseas.\\nLegislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors. \\n\\nSo what is next for program trading?\\nLeft to its own devices, index arbitrage will become more and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do profitably.\\nSpreads will become so tight that it won\\'t matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit. \\n\\nIf government or private watchdogs insist, however, on introducing greater friction between the markets (limits on price moves, two-tiered execution, higher margin requirements, taxation, etc.), the end loser will be the markets themselves.\\nInstead, we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants. \\n\\nMr. Allen\\'s Pittsburgh firm, Advanced Investment Management Inc., executes program trades for institutions. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nSome Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years. \\n\\nThe funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. \\n\\nAs a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration\\'s request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.\\nTo offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions. \\n\\nSome Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts. \\n\\nBut Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them. \"It could operate to augment our budget,\" James Rill, the Justice Department\\'s antitrust chief, said in an interview. \\n\\nUnder measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administration\\'s request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million.\\nThe FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million.\\nThe administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989. \\n\\nThe offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\\nUnder that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.\\nCurrently, the government charges nothing for such filings. \\n\\nProponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. \"When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million\" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate. \\n\\nBut Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.\\nThe antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. \"Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen,\" Mr. Edwards argued. \\n\\nAny money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large. \\n\\nCorporate lawyers said the new fees wouldn\\'t inhibit many mergers or other transactions.\\nThough some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said they hadn\\'t noticed any surge in filings. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nFALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections. \\n\\nOdd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues.\\nBut the 1989 fall total of 80, while well below 1988 activity, shows \"a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives,\" says Patrick McGuigan, editor of Family, Law and Democracy Report.\\nHe says the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade.\\nBallot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax. \\n\\nBallot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections.\\nIn California, two petition drives for next year\\'s election are \"essentially finished,\" says David Schmidt, author of \"Citizen Lawmakers.\" Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma.\\nHot ballot topics are expected to be abortion, the environment and insurance reform. \\n\\nTaking a cue from California, more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives, says David Magleby of Brigham Young University. \\n\\nPHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise. \\n\\nPrice records are being set at auctions this week.\\nAt Christie\\'s, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz\\'s \"Equivalents\" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record.\\nOther works also have been exceeding price estimates.\\nIn part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints.\\nThis information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby\\'s. \"There is finally some sort of sense in the market,\" she says. \\n\\nCorporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. \"When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren\\'t going to come back on the market.\" Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray.\\nBut much contemporary work is also fetching \"a great deal of money,\" says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography. \\n\\nDIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services. \\n\\nCurrently a $300 million-a-year business, 900 telephone service is expected to hit $500 million next year and near $2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand, says Joel Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.\\nThe service

The Pretty Big One, opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium. \\n\\nA stadium craze is sweeping the country.\\nIt\\'s fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.\\nSomething like one-third of the nation\\'s 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg. \\n\\nMost boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.\\nPepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that.\\nHe has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out.\\nStadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it. \\n\\nVoters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium.\\nSan Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.\\nLast month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.\\nIts backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion.\\nBut voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41%. \\n\\nIn San Francisco, its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls.\\nGeorge Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, won\\'t endorse the new ballpark.\\nHe says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces.\\nSince the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal \"games\" of their own with the voters. \\n\\nStadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built.\\nMiami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.\\nSeveral years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million coliseum with private funds.\\nHe didn\\'t see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit. \"This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better,\" Mr. Robbie says. \\n\\nBut to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city\\'s cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. \"The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith,\" he has said. \"It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics.\" \\n\\nAn Egyptian Pharaoh couldn\\'t have justified his pyramids

having their credit ratings lowered. \\n\\nThe reason: Risks from the firms\\' new \"merchant banking\" activities are rising as revenue from the industry\\'s traditional business erodes. \\n\\nThe downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc., coupled with a Moody\\'s announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.\\nWith the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street\\'s biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably. \\n\\nSecurities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, which they sell to finance their daily operations.\\nThe biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper. \\n\\nBut Moody\\'s warned that Shearson\\'s commercial paper rating could be lowered soon, a move that would reduce Shearson\\'s profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.\\nShearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co. \\n\\n\"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s,\" says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody\\'s vice president. \"A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible.\" Standard & Poor\\'s Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead. \\n\\nWhat worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings.\\nThat\\'s a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.\\nWhereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly, Wall Street\\'s new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years. \\n\\n\"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays\" in getting their money back, says Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at S&P, which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston. \\n\\n\"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation,\" says Mr. Mahoney of Moody\\'s.\\nMerchant banking, where firms commit their own money, \"is getting riskier, and there\\'s less of it to go around.\" In addition, he says, the buy-out business is under pressure \"because of the junk bond collapse,\" meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks. \\n\\nIn a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company\\'s operations or sales of its assets. \\n\\nIn a recent report, Moody\\'s said it \"expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability.\" It said that the \"temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor.\" \\n\\nBoth Moody\\'s and S&P cited First Boston\\'s reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm\\'s profit.\\nThe recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston\\'s most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units.\\nIn addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn\\'t repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn. \\n\\n\"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston\\'s equity,\" Moody\\'s said. \"Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm\\'s equity.\" CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland\\'s third largest bank. \\n\\nShearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business.\\nBut its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.\\nIn addition, Shearson\\'s listed $2 billion of capital is overstated, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion of goodwill.\\nShearson \"really only has $300 million of capital,\" says Mr. Bowman of S&P. \\n\\nA Shearson spokesman said the firm isn\\'t worried. \"A year ago, Moody\\'s also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade,\" he said. \"After two months of talks, our rating was maintained.\" Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating. \\n\\nThe collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.\\nThe firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal.\\nDrexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business, cutting the firm\\'s workforce almost in half to just over 5,000. \\n\\nRecently, Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.\\nThe firm\\'s capital, moreover, hasn\\'t grown at the same rate as in the past, officials at these firms say. \\n\\nDrexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness. \"We\\'re well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital,\" a Drexel spokesman said. \"And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.\\nMoreover, we\\'ve probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs, which are down around 40% over the last six months.\" \\n\\n.START \\n\\nLewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after experiencing recent heart problems. \\n\\nMost recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.\\nBut he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company\\'s Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. \\'s Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. \\n\\nUnder the so-called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle. \\n\\nThe concept\\'s goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford\\'s product development more responsive to consumer demands.\\nIt was later applied to other new-car programs, including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar. \\n\\nFord Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has \"helped to change the world\\'s perception of American-made cars.\" Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm.\\nWe can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who\\'ve been hurt.\\nBut this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation.\\nToo often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases. \\n\\nFrom the 1940s until 1971, some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.\\nThe drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies, often under generic labels.\\nIn the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users. \\n\\nThe cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn\\'t recall whose brand they used.\\nBeginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.\\nCourts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales. \\n\\nThis has some logic.\\nDrug makers shouldn\\'t be able to duck liability because people couldn\\'t identify precisely which identical drug was used.\\nBut courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.\\nJust as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.\\nThe ultimate result came in Hymowitz v.\\nLilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz\\'s mother didn\\'t use their pill must still pay their share of any damages. \\n\\nBut as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California.\\nDespite the Supreme Court\\'s refusal to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.\\nThe big problem, however, is that there\\'s no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs. \\n\\nThe problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine.\\nThe California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.\\nThe court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs. \"Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering,\" the unanimous court said.\\nThe California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market. \\n\\nThis raises the key issue: What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?\\nWe now know that holding drug makers liable where there\\'s no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won\\'t be available to anyone.\\nAs liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug \"it\\'s time to sell that company\\'s stock short.\" We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way. \\n\\nDES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.\\nCongress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.\\nBut a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children\\'s vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation. \\n\\nEveryone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.\\nWe have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.\\nThey must figure that justice has to get done by somebody, but know it won\\'t be done by Congress. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nOdyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. \\'s Caldor discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt. \\n\\nCaldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., operates 118 stores in the Northeast;

year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share. \\n\\nThe truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year.\\nIn fiscal 1988, the company earned $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million. \\n\\nOshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. \\n\\nThe company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis.\\nIn anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period.

Section was estimated at 900 million shares, in line with Tuesday\\'s 909 million. \\n\\nDeclining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues, 454 to 451. \\n\\nInvestors switched trading focus quickly as they did Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector, traders said. \\n\\nSpeculation, on the other hand, sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues, though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue.\\nThe development, traders said, showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market\\'s recent directionless trend. \\n\\nDealers led the market Wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts, observers said. \\n\\nInstitutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar. \\n\\nThe Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 16.05 points Tuesday, was down 1.46 points, or 0.05%, at 2691.19. \\n\\nThe Second Section index, which added 6.84 points Tuesday, was up 5.92 points, or 0.16%, to close at 3648.82. \\n\\nVolume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares, up from 14 million Tuesday. \\n\\nAkio Yamamoto, managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management, said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5%, institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.\\nTokyu Group, Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone/Firestone, which advanced Tuesday, declined on profit-taking.\\nWednesday\\'s dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance, which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying.\\nIt ended the day up 80 yen (56 cents) to 1,880 yen ($13.15). \\n\\nDue to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency, investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares, which traders called a \"defensive\" action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation. \\n\\nTeikoku Oil, also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying, advanced 100 yen to 1,460.\\nShowa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500. \\n\\nSumitomo Metal Mining fell five yen to 692 and Nippon Mining added 15 to 960. \\n\\nAmong other winners Wednesday was Nippon Shokubai, which was up 80 at 2,410. \\n\\nMarubeni advanced 11 to 890. \\n\\nLondon share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London\\'s blue-chip stocks. \\n\\nThe Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1.\\nIt rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading.\\nThe index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2, which was posted within the last half-hour of trading. \\n\\nDealers said most investor interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks, particularly those with limited U.K. exposure.\\nAlso, several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers. \\n\\nSterling\\'s firm tone, combined with a steady opening on Wall Street, also tempted some investors to come back to the market, dealers said.\\nThere were concerns early in the day that Wall Street\\'s sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal. \\n\\nThe FT 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1.\\nVolume was 372.9 million shares, up from 334.5 million on Tuesday. \\n\\nDealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market\\'s recent technical rally might prove fragile.\\nThey cited Wall Street\\'s recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market\\'s short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution. \\n\\nJaguar, a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors, gained 10 pence (16 cents) a share to close at 879 pence ($13.90).\\nIt shed about 7 pence, however, after dealers said the market was disappointed that Ford didn\\'t move to tender a bid for control of the company. \\n\\nDealers said the U.K. government\\'s decision Tuesday to waive its protective \"golden share\" in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants. \\n\\nBut the waiver also was seen as a signal that Ford, a major U.K. auto industry employer, was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar.\\nDealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford. \\n\\nB.A.T Industries, which is being pursued by Sir James Goldsmith\\'s Hoylake Investments, rose 9 to 753 on speculation that Hoylake will sweeten its bid, dealers said.\\nLike Jaguar, B.A.T also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings. \\n\\nReed International, a U.K. publishing group, gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7% drop in interim pretax profit. \\n\\nAnalysts said the fall in pretax profit was due to the group\\'s recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units, and that its remaining businesses are performing well.\\nDealers said the market agreed. \\n\\nStocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in FT-SE 100 shares included Carlton Communications, which climbed 32 to 778. \\n\\nDrug companies in the key index also notched gains as market-makers searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the sector\\'s defensive qualities.\\nWellcome gained 18 to 666 on a

present business conditions were \"good\" than in September.\\nAn equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good. \\n\\nAnd 19.6% of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months, compared with 18.3% in September.\\nAlso, more people said conditions will worsen in the period. (Fewer said conditions won\\'t change.) In October 1988, 21.1% said business conditions would improve. \\n\\nIn October 1989, 16.9% said more jobs will be created in the coming six months, compared with 17.4% in September and 18.6% in October 1988.\\nOnly 26.8% in October, compared with 28.5% in September and 26.8% in October 1988, said income would increase. \\n\\n\"The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer\\'s day-to-day economic life,\" said Mr. Linden. \"Unemployment continues at a relatively low level, providing a sense of job security, and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong.\" \\n\\nThe consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted in the first two weeks

\\n\\n\"There were so many economic reports but the market didn\\'t care about any of them,\" said Kathleen Camilli, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular,\" she said. \\n\\nIBM, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. \\n\\nThe size of IBM\\'s issue was increased from an originally planned $500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds. \\n\\nIn the investment-grade corporate market, \"it\\'s rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features,\" said James Ednie, a Drexel industrial bond trader. \\n\\nMoney managers ranked IBM\\'s offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent.\\nSyndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds, banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors.\\nIn the Treasury market, investors paid scant attention to the day\\'s economic reports, which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy. \\n\\n\"Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady, Őyesterday\\'sĺ economic indicators didn\\'t change your opinion,\" said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. \\n\\nThe government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower.\\nBoth indicators were viewed as signs that the nation\\'s industrial sector is growing very slowly, if at all. \\n\\nA survey by the Federal Reserve\\'s 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy.\\nIn a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed\\'s next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14., the nation\\'s central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks. \\n\\nAmong other things, the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries.\\nThe Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, for example, reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston, Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded. \\n\\nThe purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October, although it remains below 50%.\\nA reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding. \\n\\nMr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday\\'s reports \"only enhances the importance of the employment data.\" The employment report, which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices, is due out tomorrow.\\nThe average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October.\\nThe economists forecast a 0.1% rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4%. \\n\\nTreasury Securities \\n\\nIn a surprise announcement, the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week\\'s quarterly refunding of the federal debt. \\n\\nThe Treasury will raise $10 billion in fresh cash by selling $30 billion of securities, including $10 billion of new three-year notes and $10 billion of new 10-year notes. \\n\\nBut rather than sell new 30-year bonds, the Treasury will issue $10 billion of 29year, nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August. \\n\\nCredit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark, the 8 1/8% bond due August 2019, is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.\\nSome dealers said the Treasury\\'s intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities, given uncertainties about when the auction will occur. \\n\\nThe Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.\\nUntil such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading.\\nThe benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.\\nThe benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90% Tuesday.\\nThe latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90%. \\n\\nThe discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79%, while the rate on six-month bills was slightly lower at 7.52% compared with 7.60% Tuesday. \\n\\nCorporate Issues \\n\\nIBM\\'s $750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market. \\n\\nMeanwhile, most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher. \\n\\nIn its latest compilation of performance statistics, Moody\\'s Investors Service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7% in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5%.\\nMoody\\'s said those returns compare with a 3.8% total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds.\\nTotal return measures price changes and interest income. \\n\\nFor the year to date, Moody\\'s said total returns were topped by the 16.5% of longer-term Treasury issues, closely followed by 15% for investment-grade bonds.\\nJunk bonds trailed the group again. \"Even the 7.2% return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1% return from junk bonds,\" wrote Moody\\'s economist John Lonski in yesterday\\'s market report. \"Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting,\" he said. \\n\\nMoody\\'s said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2% in October. \\n\\nMortgage-Backed Issues \\n\\nMortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market. \\n\\nGinnie Mae\\'s 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 5/8, up 2/32, and its 9 1/2% issue at 100 22/32, also up 2/32. \\n\\nThe Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.32% to a 12-year average life. \\n\\nActivity was light in derivative markets, with no new issues priced. \\n\\nMunicipal Issues \\n\\nMunicipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1/8 point in light, cautious trading

John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush\\'s clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain. \\n\\nThe Michigan Democrat\\'s proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration\\'s plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.\\nThe administration\\'s plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year. \\n\\nThe proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House\\'s work on clean-air legislation.\\nAs chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation. \\n\\nPeople close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell\\'s proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered later.\\nMr. Bush\\'s legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000. \\n\\nAlthough final details weren\\'t available, sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president\\'s proposal for a cap on utilities\\' sulfur-dioxide emissions.\\nThat proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth.\\nIt also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters. \\n\\nIn addition, it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country, sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.\\nThe administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing. \\n\\nMr. Dingell\\'s staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.\\nIt isn\\'t clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House\\'s acid-rain plan. \\n\\nWhile the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.\\nLawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nAmerican City Business Journals Inc. said its president, Michael K.

the Major Market Index, a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average (traded on the chicago Board of Trade); and the S&P 100 options (traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500). \\n\\nStock-index options -- Options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price, known as the strike price.\\nFor stock indexes, the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index.\\nFor example, there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index. \\n\\nUptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security. \\n\\n(See related story: \"Balance of Power: Program-Trading War Masks Deeper Battle For Market Supremacy --- `Old Guard\\' Seizes Offensive, But Rivals Are Bigger, Richer and High-Tech --- Civil War at the Big Board\" -- WSJ Nov. 2, 1989) \\n\\n.START \\n\\nNew York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of United Airlines\\' parent, UAL Corp., saying he might seek control of the nation\\'s second-largest airline. \\n\\nAlthough takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself, the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid. \\n\\nSuch an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control.\\nBut some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings, which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold. \\n\\nTakeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it doesn\\'t mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control. \"Maybe he just wants to make something happen,\" said one takeover expert. \\n\\nOne investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid.\\nMr. Steinberg, he suggested, could replace British Airways PLC, which has withdrawn from the buy-out group. \\n\\nReliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out.\\nReliance acquired a 7% UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share. \\n\\nMarket sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake, and thus wouldn\\'t have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.\\nBut the exact amount of Reliance\\'s current holding hasn\\'t been formally disclosed. \\n\\nThe filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, has bought more than 5% of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board\\'s decision last week to remain independent.\\nSpeculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $145. \\n\\nUAL\\'s announcement came after the market closed yesterday.\\nIn composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the shares closed at $177, up $1.50.\\nUAL wouldn\\'t elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance.\\nReliance confirmed the filing but wouldn\\'t elaborate. \\n\\nSome takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL. \\n\\nMr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL\\'s Mr. Wolf.\\nThe investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc. Mr. Wolf\\'s success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987. \\n\\nBut any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company\\'s employees, primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists\\' union, which has opposed a takeover. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nA.L.

electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough. \\n\\nIn an interview, Donald Beall, chairman, said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year\\'s, primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets.\\nStill, he added, if the industrial sector remains relatively stable, Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989\\'s operating profit of $630.9 million. \\n\\nFor fiscal 1989\\'s fourth quarter, Rockwell\\'s net income totaled $126.1 million, or 50 cents a share.\\nThat compares with operating earnings of $132.9 million, or 49 cents a share, the year earlier. \\n\\nThe prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which made net $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share.\\nSales rose 4% to $3.28 billion from $3.16 billion. \\n\\nMr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company\\'s electronics segment. \\n\\nOverall, pretax electronics earnings soared 12% to $107.9 million from $96.4 million.\\nAll four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30. \\n\\nFor the year, electronics emerged as Rockwell\\'s largest sector in terms of sales and earnings, muscling out aerospace for the first time. \\n\\nThe graphics business, which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive, saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79% to $42.1 million from $23.5 million.\\nFor the year, bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press, graphics earnings almost doubled. \\n\\nAerospace earnings sagged 37% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely due to lower B-1B program profit; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988.\\nThat was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines. \\n\\nThe company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship, according to analysts. \\n\\nFor fiscal 1989, the company posted net of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share, down from $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, in fiscal 1988.\\nExcluding one-time additions to profit in each year, earnings per share were $2.47, up 7.4% from $2.30 in fiscal 1988.\\nSales for the year rose 5% to $12.52 billion from $11.95 billion in fiscal 1988.

sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil, a major grower and exporter, might not ship sugar this crop year and next. \\n\\nPrices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico, usually a large producer and exporter, might have to buy a large quantity of sugar. \\n\\nAlthough traders rushed to buy futures contracts, many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development, which couldn\\'t be confirmed, analysts said. \\n\\nThe March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.\\nThe March delivery, which has no limits, settled at 14.53 cents, up 0.56 cent a pound.\\nThe May contract, which also is without restraints, ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.\\nThe July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents, while other contract months showed near-limit advances. \\n\\nAccording to reports carried by various news services, the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won\\'t be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season, which began May 1, and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel. \\n\\nOne analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil\\'s newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can\\'t use gasoline. \"This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil,\" said Mr. Stevenson. \\n\\nBrazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.\\nA shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected, but the latest news, if true, indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated. \\n\\nDuring the current crop year, Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.\\nIts 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in \\n\\n\"It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year,\" explained Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. \"Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued\" yesterday. \\n\\nAs a result, Ms. Ganes said, it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet, even though the crop year is six months old.\\nMore than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.\\nAlso, there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane, and this change is being felt now, she said. \\n\\nMost important, Ms. Ganes noted, \"Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports.\" \\n\\nThomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: \"I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound.\" \\n\\nAbove all, Mr. Oxnard noted, the situation is extremely confused. \"Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation,\" he said. \"It\\'s the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out, such as the one saying exports will be suspended, and no one can confirm it.\" \\n\\nMr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated.\\nOn the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program. \\n\\n\"It has to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol,\" Mr. Oxnard said. \\n\\nMexico, which is normally a sugar exporter, has had production problems in the past two years, analysts said.\\nLast year, it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments, they noted.\\nThis year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs, analysts said. \\n\\nIn other commodity markets yesterday: \\n\\nENERGY: Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way.\\nOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon.\\nGasoline futures were mixed to unchanged.\\nBut the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil.\\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $20.07.\\nThe firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel. \\n\\nGRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come.\\nTrading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints\\' Day across much of Europe.\\nContinued export demand also supported prices.\\nAs an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.\\nTraders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.\\nThat designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain.\\nThe Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies, despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October. \\n\\nCOPPER: Futures prices rose, extending Tuesday\\'s gains.\\nThe December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650.\\nBuying for the most part carried over from the previous session, and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began, an analyst said.\\nAccording to news service reports, most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5% increase and other benefits.\\nHowever, some workers haven\\'t yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations, the analyst said.\\nSeparately, Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich

he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia\\'s jet planes. \\n\\nColumbia stock recently hit 4 1/8, after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private.\\nMoreover, junk professionals think Columbia\\'s huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $4.4 billion wasn\\'t enough, meaning another markdown could be coming. \\n\\nBut in recent days, Columbia has edged up, closing at 5 1/4, up 3/8, yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure.\\nMr. Spiegel\\'s fans say Columbia\\'s Southern California branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.\\nThat\\'s almost $10 of equity for each Columbia share, including convertible preferred shares, though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion. \\n\\nColumbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands.\\nThe Spiegel family has 25% of the common and 75% of the votes.\\nOther big common holders are Carl Lindner\\'s American Financial, investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research, though the latter cut its stake this summer. \\n\\nWhile many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia, investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia\\'s junk problems.\\nIndeed, Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia\\'s junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking. \\n\\nColumbia won\\'t comment on all the speculation.\\nBut like other thrifts, it\\'s expected to seek regulators\\' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity.\\nPlans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so. \\n\\nNew rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value, then sell the bonds over five years.\\nThat\\'s why Columbia just wrote off $130 million of its junk and reserved $227 million for future junk losses.\\nBut if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value, unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right. \\n\\nColumbia, a longtime Drexel client, won\\'t provide current data on its junk.\\nBut its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered.\\nThese were Allied Stores, Western Union Telegraph, Gillett Holdings, SCI Television and Texas Air, though many other bonds in Columbia\\'s portfolio also have lost value.\\nPossibly offsetting that, Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $70 million.\\nIt also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings. \\n\\nOne trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors: Columbia might be broken up, as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank.\\nBut Columbia\\'s good bank would be a regulated thrift, while the bad bank would be a private investment company, holding some of Columbia\\'s junk bonds, real estate and equity investments. \\n\\nSome think Columbia\\'s thrift, which now is seeking a new chief operating officer, might be capitalized at, say $300 million, and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence.\\nThe thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity, financial industry executives say. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders, including Mr. Spiegel, who might then have a new career, investors say. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders.\\nBut \"the concept is workable.\\nYou sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank,\" says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York. \\n\\nMr. Spiegel\\'s next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street.\\nFew people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift, which current rules would force Columbia to become. \\n\\n\"They aren\\'t really a thrift,\" says Jonathan Gray, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst. \\n\\nOf course, regulators would have to approve Columbia\\'s reorganization.\\nAnd some investment bankers say a restructuring isn\\'t feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing

Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy. \\n\\nThe book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech\\'s creation.\\nAlthough started in 1965, Wedtech didn\\'t really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government\\'s Section 8(A) minority business program.\\nThis is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.\\nMr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.\\nThe two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.\\nInstead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races. \\n\\nBesides being a \"minority-owned company\" Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.\\nThe company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan \\'80s. \\n\\nStarting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.\\nWedtech didn\\'t just use old fashioned bribery.\\nIt made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected \"respectable\" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.\\nWhen necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime. \\n\\nSometimes the bribed became partners in the company.\\nWedtech management used the merit system.\\nIf you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.\\nIf you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm\\'s semiliterate \"minority\" person. \\n\\nBut despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, \"Feeding Frenzy\" often falls short of gripping reading.\\nNone of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.\\nWedtech\\'s scammers simply bribed them to shut up. \\n\\nThe scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.\\nAmong the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.\\nThe one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.\\nHe enters the story toward the end, just in time to get arrested. \\n\\nAbsorbed in doling out \"Feeding Frenzy\\'s\" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8(A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.\\nThey do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end \"rigid affirmative action programs.\" Programs like Section 8(A) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.\\nNumerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.\\nThey take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption. \\n\\nWhy are programs like this not eliminated? \"Feeding Frenzy\" does provide a few clues.\\nIn and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.\\nThey know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.\\nThey are our version of the East bloc\\'s Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.\\nHow many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?\\nThis is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal. \\n\\nMr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983-85. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nThe Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard\\'s backlog of 15 ships. \\n\\nThe new company will attempt to limit the shipyard\\'s losses, participants said. \"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.\\nEverything will be taken over by the new company,\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. \\n\\nOnce its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine\\'s shipyard facilities.\\nSubcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine\\'s two big shipyards, government officials said. \\n\\nUnder an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million).\\nOy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. \\n\\nCustomers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine\\'s undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. \\n\\nWaertsilae Marine\\'s biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.

are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record,\" said William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert. \"It is going to be real tight.\" \\n\\nBecause of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time. \\n\\nIn a few weeks, many barges probably won\\'t be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which feeds into the Mississippi River.\\nThe Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it. \\n\\nBarge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation. \\n\\nBut the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.\\nAt St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed, an Army Corps spokesman said.\\nSimilar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years. \\n\\nSo far, the grain industry\\'s budding logistical problems haven\\'t been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.\\nMany grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers. \\n\\nAt the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $2.375 a bushel. \\n\\nCorn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought.\\nWith the harvest winding down, however, some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver. \\n\\nFarmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.\\nBecause the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles, they have more than enough storage space for their new crop, and that permits them to wait for prices to rise. \\n\\nIn parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 a bushel for corn.\\nMany farmers probably wouldn\\'t sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t clear, however, who would win a waiting game.\\nAlthough U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins. \\n\\nSome analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry\\'s problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation. \"The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped,\" said Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director. \\n\\nAlthough much of this country\\'s export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port. \\n\\nPorts in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans.\\nOne railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore. \\n\\nAnd it isn\\'t clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace.\\nThe Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays.\\nThe Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall.\\nBut its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems. \\n\\nIn other commodity markets yesterday: \\n\\nENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.\\nPrices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire, tightening an already tight European market.\\nHeating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\\nWest Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $19.94 a barrel.\\nGasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday. \\n\\nPRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.\\nDecember delivery gold fell $3.20 an ounce to $377.60.\\nDecember silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180.\\nJanuary platinum was down $5.70 an ounce at $494.50.\\nPrecious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O\\'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York. \"The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities,\" he said.\\nYesterday, the stock market rose strongly, creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said.\\nSilver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said.\\nSilver is also under pressure of \"extremely high\" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said.\\nYesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman. \\n\\nCOPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday\\'s declines because Chilean miners voted to strike.\\nThe December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14.\\nIn Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said.\\nReasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike.\\nThe analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks.\\nIn the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.\\nAlso contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents\\' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.\\nThe Purchasing Management Association of Chicago\\'s October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.\\nThe September index was 47.1%.\\nA reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.\\nThe Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nNCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers. \\n\\nThe new software is based on Novell Inc. \\'s NetWare network operating system software. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nUSX Corp. posted a 23% drop in third-quarter profit, as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations. \\n\\nThe nation\\'s largest steelmaker earned $175 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier $228 million, or 80 cents a share.\\nThe recent quarter includes pretax gains of $98 million from asset sales, while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $61 million.\\nIn the 1988 period, USX also had a $71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement.\\nSales rose 5% to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion. \\n\\nThe earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year\\'s unusually strong third quarter, when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing.\\nHowever, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, eliminating income from those operations. \\n\\nAmong segments that continue to operate, though, the company\\'s steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets.\\nPeter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that a downturn in the appliance industry, coupled with sluggish automotive sales, hurt USX results.\\nMoreover, USX exports more than other steelmakers, and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure. \\n\\nThe company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain, Ohio, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan\\'s Kobe Steel Ltd. \\n\\nIn the steel division, operating profit dropped 11% to $85 million.\\nProfit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $33 a ton from $42 a ton last year and $53 a ton in the second quarter, analysts said.\\nStill, USX fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp., which posted a 54% drop in net income, or Inland Steel Industries Inc., whose profit plummeted 70%. \\n\\nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USX shares closed up $1.25, at $34.625, as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who hadn\\'t expected as great a volume of asset sales.\\nThe rise in the stock\\'s price may also reflect the fact that USX\\'s steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers\\'. \\n\\nCharles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year.\\nHe said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products, such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet, than lower-priced structural goods. \\n\\nThe energy segment, with a 15% rise in operating profit, is clearly the company\\'s strongest.\\nHigher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $198 million from $180 million.\\nThe Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red, although losses narrowed to $9 million from $15 million.\\nUSX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO\\'s oil and gas reserves. \\n\\nProceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares.\\nThe company noted that it has reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987.\\nUSX has about $5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding. \\n\\nThe announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1% and threatened a takeover or other business combination.\\nMr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments. \\n\\nProfit for the nine months jumped 21% to $721 million, or $2.62 a share, from $598 million, or $2.07 a share.\\nSales rose 10% to $13.8 billion from $12.5 billion. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nJohn F. Barrett, 40, formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer, was named president and chief operating officer, posts which had been vacant. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nLeon J. Level, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and F. Warren McFarlan, a professor at Harvard University\\'s Graduate School of Business, were elected directors, increasing board membership to nine. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nDavid A. DiLoreto, president of metal container division, was named to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, succeeding Delmont A. Davis, who was named president and chief operating officer in August. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nTwo leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush doesn\\'t have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto. \\n\\nProfessors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents. \\n\\nA line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.\\nMr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure.\\nA White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case. \\n\\nBut the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president \"lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto.\" The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal. \\n\\nThe two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills, not partial measures.\\nMoreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.\\nThey also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and \"all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach\" of the president. \\n\\nSen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a \"reckless course of action\" for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval. \\n\\n.START \\n\\nTrinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago.\\nTerms weren\\'t disclosed. \\n\\nTrinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year. \\n\\n'"
